>Author's Note
>
>In contrast to the usual "block of text" style of spell presentation, I have broken down each spell's description into logical chunks:
>
>- Different mechanical aspects of a spell are separated out into bullet points for quick reference.
>- If a spell has multiple possible uses, these are separated out and numbered. (For example, the humble _light_ spell has three separate usages: conjuring light, blinding a creature, and dispelling _darkness_.)
>In addition, I have made the following usability enhancements:
>
>- All uses of spells that allow a saving throw are highlighted with **bold text**.
>- Spell ranges of 0 or 0' (which are applied somewhat inconsistently in the Basic/Expert rules) are replaced with a clear verbal description. (e.g. "Range: The caster", instead of "Range: 0".)
>- Likewise, spells with touch range have the additional clarification that the caster may cast the spell upon him- or herself.
>- I have taken the liberty of including a description for the mythical _detect invisible_ spell, famously missing from the Basic rules (an error that was, curiously, not corrected in the Expert rules!).
>
>It is important to note, however, that I have not attempted to clarify all ambiguities in the spell descriptions. The relatively minimal descriptions of the Basic/Expert spells sometimes lead to areas of uncertainty, where the effects or limitations of a spell are not thoroughly specified. This is regarded as a charming feature of the rule set and an encouragement for the referee to make rulings as to how each spell works in his or her campaign. I have been careful to not resolve such uncertainties, except in rare cases where an actual contradiction was present.
>
>One prominent area of unclarity is worth discussing specifically: a number of spells have effects that depend on the caster maintaining concentration. No strict definition of the requirements for concentrating is given in the Basic/Expert rules, thus some degree of referee interpretation is required. One spell---_conjure elemental_---mentions that the caster may not engage in combat or cast other spells while concentrating. The referee may wish to apply these stipulations to other spells that require concentration.

## 1st Level Cleric Spells

### <a name="cure_light_wounds"></a>Cure Light Wounds

Duration: Instant  
Range: The cleric or a creature touched

This spell has two uses:

1. Healing a living subject of 1d6+1 hit points of damage. This cannot grant more hit points than the subject's normal maximum.
2. Curing the subject of paralysis.

**Reversed: Cause Light Wounds**

Inflicts 1d6+1 hit points of damage to a touched creature. In combat, a melee attack roll is required.

### <a name="cleric_detect_evil"></a>Detect Evil

Duration: 6 turns  
Range: 120'

Objects enchanted for evil purposes or living beings with evil intentions are caused to magically glow.

- This spell does not grant the ability to read minds, but only grants a general sense of evil intent.
- The referee must decide what is "evil". Some things that are potentially harmful, like traps, are not "evil."

### <a name="cleric_detect_magic"></a>Detect Magic

Duration: 2 turns  
Range: 60'

Enchanted objects, areas, or creatures are caused to glow. Both permanent and temporary enchantments are revealed.

### <a name="cleric_light"></a>Light

Duration: 12 turns  
Range: 120'

This spell has three usages:

1. Conjuring light in a 15' radius. The magical light is sufficient for reading, but is not as bright as daylight. The spell may be cast upon an object, in which case, the light moves with the object.
2. Blinding a creature by casting the spell upon its eyes. If the target fails a **saving throw versus spells**, it is blinded for the duration. A blind creature cannot attack.
3. Cancelling a _darkness_ spell (see below).

**Reversed: Darkness**

Creates a 15' radius area of magical blackness, preventing normal sight (but not infravision). Like _light_, it may alternatively be used to blind creatures or to dispel a _light_ spell.

### <a name="cleric_protection_from_evil"></a>Protection from Evil

Duration: 12 turns  
Range: The cleric

This spell wards the cleric from attacks by creatures of another alignment, as follows:

- The cleric gains a +1 bonus to saving throws against attacks or special abilities of affected creatures.
- Affected creatures' attacks against the cleric are penalised by -1.

Additionally, the spell prevents enchanted, constructed, or summoned creatures from attacking the cleric in melee, though they may still make ranged attacks. If the cleric engages such a creature in melee, this protection is broken (the cleric still gains the bonuses to saving throws and attack rolls mentioned above).

### <a name="purify_food_and_water"></a>Purify Food and Water

Duration: Permanent  
Range: 10'

This spell makes spoiled, rotten, poisonous, or otherwise contaminated food and water pure and suitable for eating and drinking. One of the following may be affected:

- 6 quarts of drink.
- One trail ration (iron or standard).
- A quantity of unpreserved food for 12 human-sized beings.

### <a name="remove_fear"></a>Remove Fear

Duration: 2 turns  
Range: The cleric or a creature touched

The creature touched is calmed and purged of fear. Magically induced fear may be dispelled, but this requires the subject to make a **saving throw versus spells**. The save is modified by +1 per level of the cleric.

**Reversed: Cause Fear**

Will cause a target within 120' to flee for the duration unless it **saves versus spells**.

### <a name="resist_cold"></a>Resist Cold

Duration: 6 turns  
Range: 30'

All creatures within range are protected from cold, as follows:

- Unharmed by non-magical freezing temperatures.
- Gain a +2 bonus to all saving throws versus cold-based magical or breath attacks.
- Cold-based damage is reduced by 1 point per damage die rolled. (Each die inflicts a minimum of 1 hit point damage.)

## 2nd Level Cleric Spells

### <a name="bless"></a>Bless

Duration: 6 turns  
Range: 60'

May be used in one of two ways:

1. Allies within a 20' square area who are not yet in melee gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls and a +1 bonus to morale.
2. Casting _bless_ may also form part of rituals of purification or consecration, at the referee's discretion.

**Reversed: Blight**

Incurs a -1 penalty to morale checks, attacks rolls, and damage rolls of enemies within a 20' square area. A **save versus spells** is allowed to resist the _blight_.

### <a name="find_traps"></a>Find Traps

Duration: 2 turns  
Range: 30'

Trapped objects or areas within range of the cleric glow with a magical blue light.

- Both magical and mechanical traps are detected.
- No knowledge about the nature of the trap or how to deactivate it is granted.

### <a name="cleric_hold_person"></a>Hold Person

Duration: 9 turns  
Range: 180'

This spell causes one or more humans, demihumans, or humanoid monsters to be paralysed if they fail a **saving throw versus spells**. It may be cast in two ways:

1. Against an individual. The target's saving throw is penalised by -2.
2. Against a group. 1d4 individuals in the group are targeted.

Humanoids of greater than 4+1 HD and undead are not affected.

### <a name="know_alignment"></a>Know Alignment

Duration: 1 round  
Range: 10'

The cleric gains immediate knowledge of the alignment of one character, monster, object, or location within range. (Most objects or locations do not have an alignment, but magic items or holy places might.)

### <a name="resist_fire"></a>Resist Fire

Duration: 2 turns  
Range: 30'

A single creature is bestowed with supernatural resistance to fire, as follows:

- Unharmed by non-magical heat or fire.
- Gain a +2 bonus to all saving throws versus fire-based magical or breath attacks.
- Fire-based damage is reduced by 1 point per damage die rolled. (Each die inflicts a minimum of 1 hit point damage.)

### <a name="silence"></a>Silence 15' Radius

Duration: 12 turns  
Range: 180'

A 15' radius area is rendered utterly silent.

- All sound is stopped and conversation and spell casting areimpossible.
- Noise originating from outside the silenced area can be heard by those within it.
- _Silence_ may be cast upon a creature, which must **save versus spells**. If the save fails, the 15' radius area of _silence_ moves with the creature. If the save succeeds, the spell's effect remains stationary---the targeted creature may move out of it.

### <a name="snake_charm"></a>Snake Charm

Duration: 1d4+1 rounds or turns  
Range: 60'

One or more snakes are rendered non-hostile, rearing up and swaying to and fro but not attacking.

- The spell affects snakes whose total Hit Dice do not exceed the cleric's level. For example, a 7th level cleric can affect 7 HD of snakes, which can equal seven 1 HD snakes, or two 3 HD snakes and one 1 HD snake, or any other combination.
- When cast on snakes that are already attacking, the spell lasts for 1d4+1 rounds. Otherwise, it lasts for 1d4+1 turns.

### <a name="speak_with_animals"></a>Speak with Animals

Duration: 6 turns  
Range: 30'

The cleric can communicate with one type of animal within range when the spell is cast.

- Ordinary animals or giant versions of ordinary animals may be targeted.
- The cleric can ask questions of and receive answers from animals of the chosen kind, although the spell doesn't make animals any more friendly or cooperative than normal (a reaction roll may be required).
- If an animal is friendly toward the cleric, it may perform some favour or service.

## 3rd Level Cleric Spells

### <a name="cleric_continual_light"></a>Continual Light

Duration: Permanent  
Range: 120'

This spell has three usages:

1. Conjuring light in a 30' radius. The magical light is as bright as full daylight (creatures that suffer attack penalties in daylight are affected). The spell may be cast upon an object, in which case, the light moves with the object.
2. Blinding a creature by casting the spell upon its eyes. If the target fails a **saving throw versus spells**, it is blinded. A blind creature cannot attack.
3. Cancelling a _continual darkness_ spell (see below).

**Reversed: Continual Darkness**

Creates a 30' radius area of magical blackness, preventing both normal sight and infravision. Light sources brought within the area of darkness do not illuminate it. Like _continual light_, it may alternatively be used to blind creatures or to dispel a _continual light_ spell.

### <a name="cure_disease"></a>Cure Disease

Duration: Instant  
Range: 30'

This spell has two uses:

1. Cure a subject of any disease, including those of magical origin.
2. Instantly kill green slime.

**Reversed: Cause Disease**

Inflicts a terrible withering disease on a victim, if a **saving throw versus spells** is failed. The disease has the following effects:

- Death within 2d12 days.
- A -2 penalty to attack rolls.
- Natural healing takes twice the usual time.
- Magical healing is utterly ineffective.

This disease can be cured with a casting of _cure disease_.

### <a name="growth_of_animal"></a>Growth of Animal

Duration: 12 turns  
Range: 120'

One non-magical, normal animal is doubled in size when this spell is cast upon it.

- The animal's strength is doubled, along with the damage inflicted by its attacks and the amount of weight it can carry.
- This spell may be used on giant versions of normal animals, but intelligent animals and fantastic monsters are unaffected.

### <a name="cleric_locate_object"></a>Locate Object

Duration: 6 turns  
Range: 120'

The cleric can sense the direction (but not distance) of an object. One of two types of object may be located:

1. An object of a general class (e.g. a stairway, an altar, etc). In this case, the nearest object of that type is located.
2. A specific object which the cleric can clearly visualise in all aspects.

This spell cannot be used to locate creatures.

### <a name="cleric_remove_curse"></a>Remove Curse

Duration: Instant / Permanent (curse)  
Range: The cleric or a creature touched

_Remove curse_ instantaneously removes one curse from a creature. It may allow a character to discard a cursed magic item.

**Reversed: Curse**

Places a deleterious effect upon a creature, if it fails a **saving throw versus spells**.

- The exact form and effects of the curse are determined by the cleric.
- Maximum possible effects include: a -2 penalty to saving throws, a -4 penalty to hit, reducing an ability score by 50%.
- Multiple curses may afflict a creature, as long as each has a different effect.
- The referee should judge the effects of this spell and may turn overly powerful curses back onto the cleric!

### <a name="striking"></a>Striking

Duration: 1 turn  
Range: 30'

A single weapon is enchanted:

- It deals an additional 1d6 damage.
- It is able to harm monsters which are normally only harmed by magical weapons.

### <a name="cure_serious_wounds"></a>Cure Serious Wounds

The cleric's touch heals 2d6+2 hit points of damage in one living subject. This cannot grant more hit points than the subject's normal maximum.

**Reversed: Cause Serious Wounds**

Inflicts 2d6+2 hit points of damage to a touched creature. In combat, a melee attack roll is required.

### <a name="neutralize_poison"></a>Neutralize Poison

Duration: Instant  
Range: The cleric or a creature or object touched

This spell has two uses:

1. Neutralize the effects of poison on a character. A character who has died from poisoning can be revived, if neutralize poison is cast within ten rounds.

### <a name="cleric_protection_from_evil_10_foot_radius"></a>Protection from Evil 10' Radius

Duration: 12 turns  
Range: 10' around the cleric

This spell wards the cleric and all allies within 10' from attacks by creatures of another alignment, as follows:

- Those warded gain a +1 bonus to saving throws against attacks or special abilities of affected creatures.
- Affected creatures' attacks against those warded are penalised by -1.

Additionally, the spell prevents enchanted, constructed, or summoned creatures from attacking those warded in melee, though they may still make ranged attacks. If any of the warded party engages such a creature in melee, this protection is broken (those warded still gain the bonuses to saving throws and attack rolls mentioned above).

### <a name="speak_with_plants"></a>Speak with Plants

Duration: 3 turns  
Range: 30'

This spell has two uses:

1. Communication with normal plants. The cleric is able to ask questions and receive answers and may ask for simple favours. Plants may comply, if the request is within their ability to understand and perform. For example, densely overgrown plants may clear a passageway through which the cleric and party may travel.
2. Communication with plant-like or plant-based monsters.

### <a name="sticks_to_snakes"></a>Sticks to Snakes

Duration: 6 turns  
Range: 120'

## 5th Level Cleric Spells

### <a name="commune"></a>Commune

Duration: 3 turns  
Range: The cleric

The cleric calls upon divine powers in order to seek knowledge.

- The cleric may ask three questions per casting. Once per year, the cleric may ask six questions instead of the normal three.
- Each question receives a simple "yes" or "no" answer.
- _Commune_ may only be cast once per week. If the referee feels this spell is being overused, its usage may be limited to once per month.

### <a name="create_food"></a>Create Food

Duration: Permanent  
Range: Appears in the cleric's presence

Food sufficient for twelve humans and twelve mounts for one day is conjured from thin air. For each level of the cleric beyond 8th, food sufficient for an additional twelve humans and mounts is produced.

### <a name="dispel_evil"></a>Dispel Evil

Duration: Concentration (up to 1 turn) or instant (see below)  
Range: 30'

This spell has three uses:

1. By concentrating and remaining stationary, enchanted or undead monsters that come within range may be banished or destroyed. Each monster may **save versus spells** to avoid banishment or destruction. If a monster's save succeeds, it flees the affected area.
2. Instantly banish or destroy a single enchanted or undead monster within range. The monster may **save versus spells (with a -2 penalty)** to avoid banishment or destruction. If the monster's save succeeds, it flees the affected area.
3. Instantly dispel the hold that a cursed item has over a being within range.

### <a name="insect_plague"></a>Insect Plague

Duration: Concentration (up to 1 day)  
Range: 480'

Cast aboveground, this spell conjures a 60' diameter swarm of flying insects with the following properties:

- Moves at 20' per round. While the swarm is within range, the cleric is able to direct its movements.
- Vision within the area of the swarm is obscured.
- Creatures of 2 HD or less are driven away, if caught within the swarm.

If the cleric moves or loses concentration, the swarm dissipates, ending the spell.

The spell has no effect if cast underground.

### <a name="quest"></a>Quest

Duration: Until quest is completed / Instant (remove quest)  
Range: 30'

The cleric commands a single subject to perform a specific quest or task.

- Examples of quests include: rescuing a prisoner, killing a specific monster, bringing a magic item to the cleric, or going on a journey to a holy site.
- The prescribed quest must not be obviously suicidal.
- The subject may **save versus spells**, with success indicating that the quest has no effect.
- Otherwise, the subject must undertake the quest or fall under a curse (per the curse spell, with the exact nature of the curse determined by the referee).
- Once the task is completed, the spell ends.

**Reversed: Remove Quest**

Can dispel an active _quest_ spell. If the cleric who cast the _quest _spell to be nullified is higher level than the cleric casting _remove quest_, there is a chance of the spell having no effect. The probability of failure is 5% per level the cleric is below the caster of _quest_.

### <a name="raise_dead"></a>Raise Dead

Duration: Instant  
Range: 120'

This spell has two uses:

1. Restore life to a recently deceased human or demihuman. The cleric can raise a person that has been dead for no longer than four days per level of the cleric above 7th. For example, a 10th level cleric can revive a character that has been dead for twelve days (three levels above 7th × four days). Coming back from the dead is an ordeal. Until the subject gets two full weeks of bed rest, he or she has 1 hit point, moves at half the normal rate, cannot carry heavy items, and cannot attack, cast spells, or use other class abilities. This period of weakness may not be shortened by any magical healing.
2. Destroy an undead monster, if it fails a **saving throw versus spells**.

**Reversed: Finger of Death**

Directs a ray of deadly magic at a single target. If the target fails a **saving throw versus death**, it dies instantly. Casting _finger of death_ is a chaotic act; it will only be used by lawful clerics in desperate situations.

## 1st Level Magic-User Spells

### <a name="charm_person"></a>Charm Person

Duration: One or more days (see below)  
Range: 120'

A single, humanoid creature must **save versus spells** or be charmed, as follows:

- The subject regards the caster as its trusted friend and ally and will come to the caster's defence.
- If they share a language, the caster may give the charmed creature commands, which it will obey.
- Actions that the charmed creature wouldn't ordinarily do, based on its nature or alignment, may be abstained from.
- An affected creature never obeys suicidal or obviously harmful orders.

Humanoids of greater than 4+1 HD and undead are not affected.

The charm lasts indefinitely, but the subject is allowed to make further **saves vs spells** at intervals. If one of these saves succeeds, the spell ends.

- A creature with an INT score of 3-8 gains a new save once every month.
- A creature with an INT of 9-12 gains a new save each week
- A creature with an INT of 13-18 gains a new save once every day.

### <a name="detect_magic"></a>Detect Magic

Duration: 2 turns  
Range: 60'

Enchanted objects, areas, or creatures are caused to glow. Both permanent and temporary enchantments are revealed.

### <a name="floating_disc"></a>Floating Disc

Duration: 6 turns  
Range: 6'

The caster conjures a slightly concave, circular disc of magical force that follows him or her about and carries loads.

- The disc is 3 feet in diameter and 1 inch deep at its centre.
- It can hold a maximum load of 5,000 coins (500 pounds).
- The disc floats at waist height and remains level, floating along horizontally within spell range.
- When the disc winks out at the end of the spell's duration, anything it was supporting is dropped.

### <a name="hold_portal"></a>Hold Portal

Duration: 2d6 turns  
Range: 10'

This spell magically holds shut a door, gate, window, or other kind of portal.

- A _knock_ spell opens the held portal instantly.
- Creatures with at least 3 Hit Dice more than the caster can open the held portal with one round of effort.

### <a name="magic_user_light"></a>Light

Duration: 6 turns +1 per level  
Range: 120'

This spell has three usages:

1. Conjuring light in a 15' radius. The magical light is sufficient for reading, but is not as bright as daylight. The spell may be cast upon an object, in which case, the light moves with the object.
2. Blinding a creature by casting the spell upon its eyes. If the target fails a **saving throw versus spells**, it is blinded for the duration. A blind creature cannot attack.
3. Cancelling a _darkness_ spell (see below).

**Reversed: Darkness**

Creates a 15' radius area of magical blackness, preventing normal sight (but not infravision). Like _light_, it may alternatively be used to blind creatures or to dispel a _light_ spell.

### <a name="magic_missile"></a>Magic Missile

Duration: 1 turn  
Range: 150'

This spell conjures a glowing dart of energy that the caster may choose to shoot at a visible target within range.

- The missile hits unerringly (no attack roll or saving throw is required).
- The missile inflicts 1d6+1 damage.
- Higher level casters may conjure more missiles: two additional missiles are conjured per five experience levels the caster has gained (i.e. three missiles at 6th-10th level, five missiles at 11th-15th level, etc). Multiple missiles may be directed at a single target.

### <a name="magic_user_protection_from_evil"></a>Protection from Evil

Duration: 6 turns  
Range: The caster

This spell wards the caster from attacks by creatures of another alignment, as follows:

- The caster gains a +1 bonus to saving throws against attacks or special abilities of affected creatures.
- Affected creatures' attacks against the caster are penalised by -1.

Additionally, the spell prevents enchanted, constructed, or summoned creatures from attacking the caster in melee, though they may still make ranged attacks. If the caster engages such a creature in melee, this protection is broken (the caster still gains the bonuses to saving throws and attack rolls mentioned above).

### <a name="read_languages"></a>Read Languages

Duration: 2 turns  
Range: The caster

For the duration of this spell, the caster may read any language, coded message, map, or other set of written instructions. This spell does not grant any ability to speak unknown languages.

### <a name="read_magic"></a>Read Magic

Duration: 1 turn  
Range: The caster

By means of _read magic_, the caster can decipher magical inscriptions or runes, as follows:

- The magical script of a scroll of arcane spells can be understood. The caster is then able to activate the scroll at any time in the future.
- A spell book written by another arcane spell caster can be deciphered.
- Runes or magical words inscribed on an object or surface can be understood.

Once the caster has read a magical inscription using _read magic_, he or she is thereafter able to read that particular writing without recourse to the use of this spell.

### <a name="shield"></a>Shield

Duration: 2 turns  
Range: The caster

_Shield_ creates an invisible field of force that protects the caster, granting an AC of 2 against missile attacks and AC 4 against other attacks.

### <a name="sleep"></a>Sleep

Duration: 4d4 turns  
Range: 240'

A _sleep_ spell causes a magical slumber to come upon creatures, excluding the undead. The spell may target either:

- A single creature with 4+1 Hit Dice.
- A total of 2d8 Hit Dice of creatures of 4 HD or lower each.

When targeting creatures of 4 HD or less, the following rules apply:

- Targets with the least HD are affected first.
- Calculate monsters with less than 1 HD as having 1 HD and monsters with a bonus to HD as having the flat amount. (For example, a 3+2 HD monster would be calculated as having 3 HD.)

## 2nd Level Magic-User Spells

### <a name="magic_user_continual_light"></a>Continual Light

Duration: Permanent  
Range: 120'

This spell has three usages:

1. Conjuring light in a 30' radius. The magical light is sufficient for reading, but is not as bright as daylight. The spell may be cast upon an object, in which case, the light moves with the object.
2. Blinding a creature by casting the spell upon its eyes. If the target fails a **saving throw versus spells**, it is blinded. A blind creature cannot attack.
3. Cancelling _continual darkness_.

**Reversed: Continual Darkness**

### <a name="invisibility"></a>Invisibility

Duration: Permanent (but may be broken, see below)  
Range: 240'

The caster or another creature or object within range becomes invisible:

- If cast on a creature, any gear the subject is carrying is also rendered invisible (this includes clothing and armour). Items dropped or put down by an invisible creature become visible. If the subject attacks or casts a spell, the invisibility is broken, ending the spell.
- If cast on an object, the invisibility is permanent.
- Note that if a light source is made invisible (either as part of a creature's gear or as an individual object), the light it casts is unaffected.

### <a name="knock"></a>Knock

2. An illusionary attack of some kind (an avalanche, a falling ceiling, a magic missile, etc). Targets who **save versus spells** are unaffected.
3. A scene of some kind, either changing the appearance of the affected area or creating the appearance of something new. The scene disappears if touched.

The following stipulations apply:

- Concentration is required to maintain the illusion: if the caster moves or is affected by an attack, the spell ends.

Additionally, the spell prevents enchanted, constructed, or summoned creatures from making melee attacks against those warded, though they may still make ranged attacks.

- If a PC or NPC with levels in a class is reanimated by this spell, the levels are not counted as HD. For example, the reanimated corpse of a 5th level fighter would have 2 HD (1 HD as a normal human, +1 for being reanimated as a zombie).

### <a name="cloudkill"></a>Cloudkill

Duration: 6 turns  
Range: 30'

A poisonous fog streams from the caster's fingertips, filling a 30' diameter area.

- The fog moves at 60' per turn (20' per round), driven by the wind (or away from the caster, in still conditions).
- Because the fog is heavier than air, it sinks to the lowest level of the land, even pouring down den or sinkhole openings.
- All creatures in contact with the vapours suffer 1 hit point of damage per round of contact. Creatures with less than 5 Hit Dice must also **save versus death** (also once per round of contact) or die.

### <a name="conjure_elemental"></a>Conjure Elemental

Duration: Permanent (until dismissed or slain)  
Range: 240'

A 16 Hit Dice [elemental](monsters.md#elemental) is summoned from an elemental plane of the caster's choice (air, earth, fire, water) to do his or her bidding.

- A large volume of the appropriate element is required for the summons to work.
- Commanding an elemental requires great concentration: the caster may not take part in combat, cast other spells, or move at greater than half speed.
- While control over the elemental is maintained, the caster may dismiss it at any time, sending it back to its plane of origin.
- If the caster's concentration is disturbed, the spell's command of the elemental ends. It is, henceforth, a free-willed entity and will immediately try to kill the caster and any who get in its way.
- A conjured elemental may be dispelled by _dispel magic_ or _dispel evil_.
- The caster may summon at most one elemental from each plane in a single day.

### <a name="contact_higher_plane"></a>Contact Higher Plane

Duration: One conversation  
Range: The caster

A channel of communication is opened to a higher plane of existence, allowing the caster to ask powerful, otherworldly beings for advice and knowledge on any subject.

- The caster must choose which plane of existence to contact: communion with beings of the 3rd to 12th planes is possible via this spell. Higher numbered planes are home to more powerful and knowledgeable beings.
- The caster may then ask a number of simple yes/no questions equal to the number of the plane contacted. The referee plays the role of the contacted being, responding to the caster's questions.
- For each question asked, there is a chance of the contacted being not knowing the answer or of answering untruthfully: see the chart below. (It is impossible to detect whether the entity is lying.)

Casting _contact higher plane_ is a great and perilous deed.

- It may be cast at most once per week. (The referee may limit the spell's usage to even less frequently, if desired.)
- Communion with otherworldly beings of great power can shatter the caster's sanity. The basic chance is shown in the chart above. For every level of the caster above 11, this chance is reduced by 5%. If the caster is driven insane as a result of the communion, the recovery time is a number of weeks equal to the number of the plane contacted.

Plane | #Questions | Don't Know | Truth | Insanity
----|---|-----|-----|-----
3rd | 3 | 75% | 50% | 5%
4th | 4 | 70% | 55% | 10%
5th | 5 | 65% | 60% | 15%
6th | 6 | 60% | 65% | 20%
7th | 7 | 50% | 70% | 25%
8th | 8 | 40% | 75% | 30%
9th | 9 | 30% | 80% | 35%
10th | 10 | 20% | 85% | 40%

The following stipulations apply, when the caster's life-force is **_in the magic jar_**:

- The caster may attempt to possess the body of another creature within 120'. The victim may **save versus spells** to resist possession. If the save is successful, the caster may not make another attempt to possess that victim for one turn.

- The caster may choose to return to his or her own body at any time, ending the spell.
- If the _magic jar_ is destroyed, the caster dies.
- If the caster's own body is destroyed, his or her life-force is stranded in the _magic jar_.

- An unwilling subject may **save versus spells** to prevent the teleportation.
- The selected destination may be at any distance, but must be known to the caster and an open space at ground level. (It is not possible to intentionally teleport the subject into mid-air or into solid matter.)

There is a risk, when teleporting, of accidentally arriving above or below ground level. The chance of a successful teleportation depends on the caster's knowledge of the destination (see below). Roll d% and consult the following chart:

Knowledge of Destination | Ground Level | Too High | Too Low
-------------------------|--------------|----------|--------
Scant | 01-50 | 51-75 | 76-00
Moderate | 01-80 | 81-90 | 91-00
Exact | 01-95 | 96-99 | 00

- **_Ground level:_** The subject appears at the desired destination.
- **_Too high:_** The subject appears 1d10×10 feet above the intended destination. Should this location already be occupied by solid matter, the subject is instantly killed. Otherwise, the subject falls (suffering 1d6 damage per 10' fallen).
- **_Too low:_** The subject appears in the ground and is killed instantly.

The caster's knowledge of the destination is rated as follows:

- **_Scant:_** A location that the caster has visited once or twice, has seen by magical scrying, or has heard of from descriptions.
- **_Moderate:_** A location that the caster has visited often or has studied via scrying for several weeks.
- **_Exact:_** A location that the caster has made a detailed study of, in person.

An anti-magic barrier is created around the caster. No spells or spell effects can pass through this barrier, whether from inside or outside. The caster may end this spell at any time before the duration has expired.

### <a name="control_weather"></a>Control Weather

Duration: Concentration  
Range: 240 yards around the caster

By concentrating (no movement allowed), the caster causes one of the following conditions to manifest around him or her. This spell only functions outdoors.

- **_Calm:_** Clears bad weather (though side-effects---e.g. mud after rain---remain.)
- **_Extreme heat:_** Dries up snow or mud (including _transmute rock to mud_). Creatures in the area move at half normal rate.
- **_Foggy:_** Visibility drops to 20'. Creatures in the fog move at half their normal rate. At the referee's option, they may also have a chance of getting lost.
- **_High winds:_** Movement rates are halved. Missile fire and flight are impossible. At sea, may be used to increase the sailing speed of ships by 50%, if they travel with the wind. In sandy areas, may cause a sandstorm, reducing visibility to 20'.
- **_Rainy:_** -2 penalty to missile attacks. Mud forms in 3 turns, halving movement rates.
- **_Snowy:_** Visibility drops to 20'. Movement rates are halved. Bodies of water may freeze. After the snow thaws, mud remains and still impedes movement.
- **_Tornado:_** The caster can direct the tornado, which moves at 120' per round. The tornado can be directed to attack, using the stats for a 12 HD [air elemental](monsters.md#air_elemental). Ships caught in a tornado have a 75% chance of suffering 12 points of hull damage.

### <a name="death_spell"></a>Death Spell

Duration: Instant  
Range: 240'

Up to 4d8 Hit Dice of creatures within a 60' cube area must **save versus death or die**, instantly. Undead and creatures with greater than 7 Hit Dice are unaffected.

### <a name="disintegrate"></a>Disintegrate

Duration: Instant  
Range: 60'

The material form of a single, non-magical creature or object is unwoven, causing it to instantly and permanently cease to exist.

- If a creature is targeted, it may **save versus death** to resist disintegration.
- Examples of objects that might be targeted: a tree, a ship, a 10' section of wall.

### <a name="geas"></a>Geas

Duration: Permanent / Instant (remove geas)  
Range: 30'

The caster commands a subject to perform or avoid performing a specific action.

- Examples include: bringing a specific item to the caster, eating or drinking without restraint, keeping a certain fact secret.
- The prescribed _geas_ must not be impossible or directly deadly---if such a _geas_ is cast, it affects the caster, instead.
- The subject may **save versus spells**, to avoid coming under the spell's effect.
- If the save fails, the subject must follow the stipulated course of action or suffer gradually increasing (and eventually fatal) penalties determined by the referee. For example: penalties to attack, ability score reductions, inability to memorize spells, physical torment and feebleness, etc.

**Reversed: Remove Geas**

Can dispel an active _geas_ spell and any incurred penalties. If the caster of the _geas_ to be nullified is higher level than the character casting _remove geas_, there is a chance of the spell having no effect. The probability of spell failure is 5% per level the caster is below the caster of _geas_.

### <a name="invisible_stalker"></a>Invisible Stalker

Duration: One mission  
Range: Summoned to caster's presence

An [invisible stalker](monsters.md#invisible_stalker) is summoned to the caster's presence and magically bound to perform a mission of the caster's choosing.

- The caster must be careful with the wording of the mission. Invisible stalkers are treacherous and, unless the assigned mission can be easily and quickly accomplished, will follow the letter of the command while twisting the intent.
- The creature is bound to attempt the mission until it succeeds or is destroyed.
- The spell _dispel evil_ will banish an invisible stalker, ending the spell.

### <a name="lower_water"></a>Lower Water

Duration: 10 turns  
Range: 240'

This spell reduces the depth of a body of water by half for the duration. An area of up to 10,000 square feet may be affected.

### <a name="move_earth"></a>Move Earth

Duration: 6 turns  
Range: 240'

Earth (but not stone) within range is rearranged as the caster wishes.

- The range of the spell also extends downwards, allowing excavations to be made.
- The caster can move earth in the area at up to 60' per turn.

### <a name="part_water"></a>Part Water

Duration: 6 turns  
Range: 120'

The caster creates a path 10' wide and a maximum of 120' long through water, such as a pond, lake, or other body. The caster can dismiss the spell's effect before the duration ends.

### <a name="projected_image"></a>Projected Image

Duration: 6 turns  
Range: 240'

An illusory duplicate of the caster appears within range.

- The image is an exact duplicate of the caster that can only be differentiated by touch.
- Subsequent spells cast appear to originate from the image. (Targets must still be visible to the caster, however.)
- The image appears unaffected by spells or missile weapons.
- If the image is touched or hit in melee, it disappears.

### <a name="reincarnation"></a>Reincarnation

Duration: Permanent  
Range: Appears in the caster's presence

A dead character is returned to life in a new physical form that manifests in the presence of the caster. The character's new body is not necessarily the same as the original; it is determined by rolling on the topmost table below.

The roll indicates either a character class or a monster:

- **_Character class:_** The character is of experience level 1d6 (or at most the same level as the character achieved before death). The reincarnated character can continue to gain experience and advance as normal, in the new class.
- **_Monster:_** The type should be determined by the referee. The monster should be at least partially intelligent, have no greater Hit Dice than the level of the character being reincarnated (at most 6 HD), and be of the same alignment. The tables below may be used or the referee may create his or her own tables. Monsters cannot gain experience or advance in level.

The descriptions and stats of the monsters listed in the standard tables given here can be found in [**_B/X Essentials: Monsters_**](monsters.md).

### <a name="stone_to_flesh"></a>Stone to Flesh

Duration: Permanent  
Range: 120'

This spell transforms stone into living flesh. It is especially useful for restoring life to a petrified creature and its equipment to its normal state.

**Reversed: Flesh to Stone**

Turns one creature into a statue, including all gear and any items currently held. A **saving throw versus paralysis** is permitted to resist the transformation.
