## Notes

### High-Level Saves

Some powerful monsters save as a fighter of greater than 14th level. In these cases, the monster's save values have been calculated by extrapolating the progression of the fighter saving throw chart to higher levels.

### Infravision

All non-human monsters have 60' infravision. (See **_B/X Essentials: Core Rules_**.)

### Persons

Spells such as _charm person_, _hold person_, etc. only affect humanoids (including humans and demihumans) of up to 4+1HD. Monsters in this book that are affected by these spells are: acolyte, bandit, berserker, brigand, buccaneer, bugbear, dervish, dwarf, elf, gnoll, gnome, goblin, halfling, hobgoblin, kobold, lizard man, medium, merchant, neanderthal, nixie, noble, normal human, ogre, orc, pirate, pixie, sprite, trader, troglodyte, veteran. Other monsters may be affected at the referee's judgement.

### XP Value of NPCs

Some monster entries make reference to NPCs with levels in a specific character class. The XP values for such characters are not pre-calculated, as the exact value depends on several variable factors.

When awarding XP for defeated NPCs, the referee may use the following guidelines:

- The base Hit Dice are equal to the NPC's experience level.
- Spell casters are treated as having one special ability per two levels of spells they can cast (rounded up). For example, a character able to cast 1st, 2nd, and 3rd level spells would count as having two special abilities.
- Magic items in the possession of the character may be counted as special abilities, if they play a direct role in combat.

## Stat Block Format

**_AC:_** Armour Class.

**_HD:_** Hit Dice. Roll this number of d8s to determine each individual's hit points.

- One or more asterisks after the HD number indicate the number of special abilities the monster has, for the purpose of XP calculation.
- Modifiers to the HD (e.g. +3, -1) are applied to the hit point total, after rolling the appropriate number of d8s.
- Some monsters are listed as having less than one HD, either as 1/2 (roll 1d4) or as a fixed number of hit points.
- The average hit point value is also listed, in parentheses.

**_Att:_** Attacks usable each round. Square brackets are used to distinguish between alternative attack routines that a monster may choose from.

**_SV:_** The monster's saving throw values: D=death/poison, W=wands, P=paralysis/petrification, B=breath attacks, S=spells/rods/staves. The equivalent character class and level are listed in parentheses afterwards (C=Cleric, D=Dwarf, E=Elf, F=Fighter, H=Halfling, MU=Magic-User, NH=Normal Human, T=Thief).

**_THAC0:_** Value required "to hit AC 0". This value may optionally be used to resolve the monster's attack rolls, instead of referring to the attack chart based on its HD. To calculate the AC hit by an attack, subtract the result of the attack roll from the THAC0 score. For example, if a monster with THAC0 12 makes an attack roll of 9, it hits AC 3 (12 - 9).

**_MV:_** Base movement rate; encounter movement rate in parentheses. If the monster has multiple modes of movement, they are listed individually, separated by slashes.

**_ML:_** Morale rating.

**_AL:_** Alignment. If "any" is listed, the referee may roll randomly or choose the creature's alignment.

**_XP:_** Pre-calculated XP award for defeating the monster.

**_NA:_** Number appearing. Two values are listed, the second in parentheses. These values are used as follows:

- Wandering (dungeon): The first value indicates the number of monsters encountered roaming in a dungeon level equal to their HD. If the listed value is zero, these monsters are not usually encountered in dungeons. If the monster is encountered on a level greater than its HD, the number appearing may be increased; if encountered on a level less than its HD, the number appearing should be reduced.
- Lair (dungeon): The second value lists the number of monsters found in a lair in a dungeon. If the listed value is zero, these monsters do not usually have lairs.
- Wandering (wilderness): The second value indicates the number of monsters encountered roaming in the wilderness. If the listed value is zero, these monsters are not usually encountered in the wilderness.
- Lair (wilderness): The second value multiplied by 5 indicates the number of monsters found in a lair in the wilderness. If the listed value is zero, these monsters are not usually encountered in the wilderness.

**_TT:_** Treasure type. The letter code used to determine the amount and type of treasure possessed by the monster(s) (see **_B/X Essentials: Adventures and Treasures_**). The letters listed are used as follows:

- A to O: Indicate a hoard: the sum wealth of a large monster or a community of smaller monsters. Such hoards are usually hidden in the lair. For monsters with a lair encounter size (see NA, above) of greater than 1d4, the amount of treasure in the hoard may be reduced, if the number of monsters is below average.
- P to V: If listed for an intelligent monster, indicate treasure carried by individuals (P to T) or a group (U, V). If listed for an unintelligent monster, indicates treasure from the bodies of its former victims.

- **_Attack pattern:_** A dragon always attacks first with its breath weapon, then either breathes again or makes melee attacks (equal chance of either).
- **_Breath weapon:_** Can be used up to three times per day. All caught in the area suffer damage equal to the dragon's current hit points (**save vs breath** for half). Shapes of breath weapon:

- **_Subduing:_** Will surrender if reduced to 0hp by non-lethal attacks (see **_Non-Lethal Combat in B/X Essentials: Core Rules_**), admitting that it has been defeated. (Subdual damage does not reduce the damage done by the breath weapon.)

- **_Age:_** The following stats describe dragons of average size. Younger dragons may have up to 3 HD less and 1/4 or 1/2 as much treasure. Older dragons may have up to 3 HD more and twice as much treasure.
