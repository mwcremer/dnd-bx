## <a name="adventure_scenarios"></a>Adventure Scenarios

The first step in designing an adventure of any kind is to decide on the type of scenario. This is the hook that draws the player characters to the adventure site, and provides a background theme that the referee can use to tie the location together. The scenario drives the referee's choices of specific traps, treasures, and monsters to be placed in the location. The following examples may be used for inspiration.

### <a name="banishing_ancient_evil"></a>1. Banishing Ancient Evil

An evil presence (e.g. a monster or NPC) must be banished or destroyed. It may have been dormant for many years, and have only recently been awakened (perhaps as a result of another party's meddling).

### <a name="clearing_ruins"></a>2. Clearing Ruins

Settlers plan to move into an abandoned settlement or stronghold. Before they arrive, the PCs need to scout the area and clear out any monsters or other dangers that inhabit the place. The ruins need not be in a remote area---they could even be within (or beneath) a major settlement.

### <a name="contacting_a_lost_civilisation"></a>3. Contacting a Lost Civilisation

The PCs discover a long-lost race in a fantastic location. They may have once been human, but are now adapted to their strange environment. For example, they may have reverted to bestial behaviour, or may be adapted to subterranean life, with pale skin and infravision.

### <a name="escaping_from_captivity"></a>4. Escaping from Captivity

The PCs have been taken prisoner by an enemy, and begin the adventure in captivity, possibly with a grisly fate awaiting them in the near future. They must regain their freedom.

### <a name="exploring_unknown_territory"></a>5. Exploring Unknown Territory

An NPC hires the party to explore and map an unknown region. This may be a previously uncharted area, or may be a recent alteration to a familiar region (e.g. a magic castle may appear in an empty plain).

### <a name="performing_a_quest"></a>6. Performing a Quest

A deity or powerful NPC (e.g. a king) sends the PCs on a quest. This may involve recovering holy or magical items.

### <a name="rescuing_captives"></a>7. Rescuing Captives

Important NPCs have been kidnapped by bandits, wicked monsters, or an evil wizard. The PCs attempt to rescue the prisoners, either seeking a reward, or because of a personal connection with the unfortunate captives. It is also possible that the PCs may be hired as bodyguards to NPCs who are negotiating with the kidnappers.

### <a name="scouting_an_enemy_outpost"></a>8. Scouting an Enemy Outpost

An invasion is looming (or in progress)! The PCs are tasked with infiltrating an outpost of the enemy, gathering reconnaissance as to their plans, strengths, and weaknesses, and (if possible) destroying them.

### <a name="seeking_a_magical_doorway"></a>9. Seeking a Magical Doorway

A gateway exists that allows magical travel (either one-way, or bidirectional) between distant locations or even other worlds. The PCs may be tasked with locating a lost portal, or closing a portal used by enemies. The portal may also be the only means of travel to a fantastic destination that the PCs must visit.

### <a name="visiting_a_sacred_site"></a>10. Visiting a Sacred Site

In order to consult with an oracle, remove a curse, or find a holy relic, the PCs must journey to a sacred site (e.g. a shrine or temple). The exact location of the site is usually a matter of conjecture.

## <a name="designing_a_dungeon"></a>Designing a Dungeon

### <a name="choose_setting"></a>1. Choose Setting

The central location of an adventure is often a dungeon of some kind. The referee should decide on the basic form and structure of the dungeon, and can begin to come up with ideas for the main rooms or areas. The following table may be used to decide the basic form.

d6 | Setting
--|----------------------
1 | Crypt or tomb complex
2 | Natural caverns
3 | Settlement (e.g. castle, village, city)
4 | Subterranean delving (e.g. mine)
5 | Temple
6 | Tower or fortification

### <a name="choose_monsters"></a>2. Choose Monsters

Based on the selected [**_adventure scenario_**](#adventure_scenarios) and dungeon setting, the referee should decide what types of monsters inhabit the dungeon. Monsters may be selected from [**_B/X Essentials: Monsters_**](monsters.md) or other monster books that the referee has available. The referee may also wish to create new monsters specially for the dungeon, or to alter standard monsters to tailor them to the location.

### <a name="map_the_dungeon"></a>3. Map the Dungeon

Typically, dungeon maps are drawn on graph paper, with a scale of 10' per square. (Larger or smaller scales may be used, as appropriate.) The overall shape of the dungeon---the structure of the rooms and connecting passages (e.g. rough, cavern walls; carefully laid-out defensive structures; etc.)---will be determined by the dungeon setting.

Each area (e.g. room or cave) of the dungeon should be numbered, so that the area on the map can easily be cross-referenced with the description of its contents (see step 4).

### <a name="stock_the_dungeon"></a>4. Stock the Dungeon

The referee should note down a description of each numbered area from the map.

- The description should note any monsters, traps, tricks, treasures, or special magical effects that are present (including the possibility of patrols in the area).
- Generally, the level of danger and the amount of treasure in a dungeon should be suitable to the level of the PCs.
- Additional, descriptive details for each area may also be noted: furnishings, everyday items, smells, sounds, lights, etc.

Monsters or areas that play an important role in the adventure background should be noted first. Areas of less importance may then be stocked, using the guidelines to the right, as desired.

#### <a name="unguarded_treasure"></a>Unguarded Treasure

Treasure is usually guarded by monsters or traps, but sometimes an unguarded cache of treasure may be found. The following guidelines should be borne in mind:

- When designing dungeons for experienced players, the referee should consider placing only very few completely unguarded treasures.
- The referee may wish to not place any unguarded treasures in the 9th or deeper dungeon levels.

#### <a name="random_dungeon_room_contents"></a>Random Dungeon Room Contents

d6 | Room Type | Chance of Treasure
----|-------|-------
1-2 | Empty | 1-in-6
3-4 | Monster | 3-in-6
5 | Special | None
6 | Trap | 2-in-6

- **_Monsters:_** May be selected by hand or rolled (see [**_Dungeon Encounter Tables_**](#dungeon_encounter_tables)).
- **_Specials:_** Unusual, magical, or weird features of an area. This can include tricks or puzzles.
- **_Traps:_** If treasure is present, the trap may be set so that it is triggered when the treasure is tampered with (a _treasure trap_). Otherwise, the trap may be triggered by simply entering the room or a certain area of it (a _room trap_).
- **_Treasure:_** If a monster is in the room, roll the treasure type indicated in its description. Otherwise, the treasure depends on the dungeon level.

#### <a name="example_room_traps"></a>Example Room Traps

1. **_Falling block:_** Inflicts 1d10 damage (**save vs petrification** to avoid).
2. **_Gas:_** Poisonous gas fills the room (**save vs poison** or die).
3. **_Mist:_** Harmless; looks like poisonous gas.
4. **_Pit:_** Opens up beneath characters' feet. Characters who fall in suffer damage when they hit the bottom (see [**_Falling_**](core.md#falling)).
5. **_Scything blade:_** Swings from the ceiling; attacks for 1d8 damage.
6. **_Slide:_** Opens up beneath characters' feet, sending them to a lower level.

### <a name="example_specials"></a>Example Specials

1. **_Alarms:_** Entry alarm that attracts nearby guardians.
2. **_Animating objects:_** Inanimate objects that attack if disturbed.
3. **_Falling blocks:_** Stone block falls to prevent passage.
4. **_Illusions:_** Illusionary passages, doors, or stairways.
5. **_Shifting architecture:_** Doors lock; room rotates, rises, or falls.
6. **_Strange waters:_** Pool or fountain with weird, magical effects.
7. **_Teleports:_** Magical portal or teleporter to another area of the dungeon.
8. **_Trapdoors:_** Leading to a hidden area.
9. **_Voices:_** Walls or architectural features speak or moan (e.g. a talking statue).

### <a name="example_treasure_traps"></a>Example Treasure Traps

1. **_Darts:_** 1d6 spring-loaded darts fire at the character, doing 1d4 damage each.
2. **_Hidden monster:_** Released when the treasure is tampered with (e.g. a snake).
3. **_Illusion:_** Typically of a monster. The monster has AC 9 and vanishes if hit in combat. Attacks do not inflict real damage: a character who appears to die actually falls unconscious for 1d4 turns.
4. **_Light flash:_** Causes blindness for 1d8 turns (**save versus spells**).
5. **_Spray:_** A mysterious liquid covers the character; monsters are attracted to the smell. The chance of wandering monsters is doubled for 1d6 hours.
6. **_Sprung needle:_** A needle coated with poison jabs out (**save vs poison** or die).

### <a name="treasure"></a>Treasure

- **_Level 1:_** 1d6 &times; 100sp; 50%: 1d6 &times; 10gp; 5%: 1d6 gems; 2%: 1d6 pieces of jewellery; 2%: 1 magic item.
- **_Level 2-3:_** 1d12 &times; 100sp; 50%: 1d6 &times; 100gp; 10%: 1d6 gems; 5%: 1d6 pieces of jewellery; 8%: 1 magic item.

- **_Level 8-9:_** 1d6 &times; 5,000sp; 1d6 &times; 1,000gp; 40%: 1d12 gems; 20%: 1d12 pieces of jewellery; 20%: 1 magic item.

See [**_Gems and Jewellery_**](#gems_and_jewellery) and [**_Magic Items_**](#magic_items) for more details.

## <a name="designing_a_wilderness"></a>Designing a Wilderness

### <a name="choose_setting"></a>1. Choose Setting

The referee should decide on the basic geography and climate of the region to be described: whether it primarily consists of mountains, forest, desert, etc. The size of the region should also be determined.

When starting a new campaign, it is recommended that the referee begin by detailing a small, self-contained area that can be expanded upon in time.

At this stage, the referee should also consider the nature of the milieu being detailed: the general level of technology, availability of magic, presence of different monsters and intelligent races, and so on.

### <a name="map_the_region"></a>2. Map the Region

Using graph or hex paper, the referee should create a map of the wilderness area, marking on the major terrain features such as mountain ranges, rivers, seas, lakes, islands, forests, swamps, and so on. Real world maps may serve as inspiration as to the natural structure and relationship of terrain features.

Typically, a large scale map (24 miles per hex) is drawn first, followed by smaller scale maps (6 miles per hex) of certain areas, adding more detail.

### <a name="locate_human_realms"></a>3. Locate Human Realms

The areas of the map that are controlled by humans should be marked on the map, bearing in mind the needs of human civilisation (rivers, farmland, etc.). The base town (see step 5) is typically located within one of these regions. The referee should also note the ruler of each human-controlled area, whether it be a petty lord, a mighty king, a consortium of merchants, etc.

### <a name="locate_non_human_realms"></a>4. Locate Non-Human Realms

Regions that are controlled by other intelligent species that exist in the setting (e.g. demihumans, monstrous races, and so on) should be marked on the map, taking their preferred environment and lifestyle into account. Some intelligent species may keep domains with well-defined boundaries, while others may move around---hunting or raiding---within a more vaguely defined area.

The territories of significant, non-intelligent monsters may also be marked on the map at this stage.

### <a name="place_the_base_town"></a>5. Place the Base Town

A base town for player characters should be located on the map, typically close to a river or road, near the centre of the map. This is where play will begin. The guidelines to the right may be used to help flesh out the base town.

### <a name="place_dungeons"></a>6. Place Dungeons

The referee may place one or more dungeons on the map, somewhere in the vicinity of the base town. Dungeons are normally located around a day's journey from the base town---close enough that travel between the town and the dungeon is convenient, but not so close that the town is plagued by monsters from the dungeon.

### <a name="create_regional_encounter_tables"></a>7. Create Regional Encounter Tables

The standard [**_Wilderness Encounter Tables_**](#wilderness_encounter_tables) may be suited for use in some areas of the campaign map. For other areas, the referee may prefer to create new tables, with a selection of monsters customised to the area. Special encounter tables should take account of the intelligent and monstrous species marked on the map.

## <a name="designing_a_base_town"></a>Designing a Base Town

### <a name="size"></a>1. Size

Decide how large the base town is and roughly how many inhabitants it has:

Town Size | Inhabitants
----------|------------
Village | 50 - 999
Small Town | 1,000 - 4,999
Large Town | 5,000 - 14,999
City | 15,000+

### <a name="services"></a>2. Services

The referee should make some notes on the presence of the following services that adventurers will require:

- **_Black market:_** For selling treasure and contacting thieves or smugglers.
- **_Guard:_** A town militia to keep the peace and protect the town. It may be useful to note whether the guards are open to bribery, and how frequently they patrol various areas of the town.
- **_Healing:_** A temple, church, or shrine where healing magic (possibly including means of raising the dead) is available.
- **_Lodgings:_** Inns or rooms to rent.
- **_Rumours:_** Places where notices are posted and gossip spreads.

### <a name="ruler"></a>3. Ruler

The referee should decide how the town is ruled: whether by a local sheriff or mayor appointed by a lord, an elected council, a confederacy of merchants, etc. It is also possible that a high-level NPC adventurer (with attendant guards and magic) may rule the town.

### <a name="other_npcs"></a>4. Other NPCs

Other important NPCs in the town should be noted, especially those associated with one of the services mentioned above, or those who might wish to hire the PCs to undertake missions.

### <a name="rumours"></a>5. Rumours

A few local rumours may be noted, to provide hooks for the player characters to start exploring the local area, and possibly find their way to one of the placed dungeons.

## <a name="dungeon_encounter_tables"></a>Dungeon Encounter Tables

This section provides encounter tables by dungeon level, using the monsters found in [**_B/X Essentials: Monsters_**](#monsters.md). Referees who are using additional (or alternative) monsters should either adapt the tables to include these, or should create their own encounter tables. Special tables may also be created to reflect the different balance of monsters inhabiting a specific dungeon.

### <a name="how_to_roll_an_encounter"></a>How to Roll an Encounter

Roll 1d20 and look up the result on the column in the table below that corresponds to the dungeon level being explored. The result indicates the monster encountered, with the number appearing in parentheses.

### <a name="notes"></a>Notes

- **_NPC adventurers:_** Encounters with NPC adventuring parties are listed in the tables as "Basic Adventurers" or "Expert Adventurers". Guidelines for generating NPC adventurers can be found in [**_NPC Parties_**](#npc_parties).
- **_Number appearing:_** The values listed in the tables for some monsters do not match the values listed in [**_B/X Essentials: Monsters_**](monsters.md). If desired, the referee may use the number appearing value listed in the monsters book, for consistency.

## <a name="stronghold_encounters"></a>Stronghold Encounters

High-level adventurers may create a base in a wilderness area by driving dangerous monsters out of the area, building a castle or stronghold, and hiring an army of mercenaries for protection. When PCs wander into the vicinity of such a stronghold, a warm reception is not always guaranteed. The referee may already have notes on the patrols around a stronghold, and the reaction of the ruler to travellers. If not, the following guidelines may be used.

### <a name="ruler"></a>Ruler

The referee should decide what class of NPC claims ownership of the stronghold and the surrounding lands:

- **_Arcane spell caster:_** (e.g. magic-user.) Of level 1d4+10.
- **_Divine spell caster:_** (e.g. cleric.) Of level 1d8+6.
- **_Warrior or combat-oriented character:_** (e.g. fighter.) Of level 1d6+8.

Note that demihuman strongholds are unusual cases, and should be detailed in advance by the referee. Typically, they will attempt to avoid all contact with travellers.

### <a name="patrols"></a>Patrols

Adventurers who enter the dominion around a stronghold will typically be spotted by one of the mercenary groups hired to patrol the area. The type of troops depends on the class of the ruler:

- **_Arcane spell caster:_** 2d6 heavy footmen. Equipped with chainmail + shield (AC 4) and swords. Morale 8.
- **_Divine spell caster:_** 2d6 medium horsemen. Equipped with chainmail (AC 5) and lances. Morale 9.
- **_Warrior or combat-oriented character:_** 2d6 heavy horsemen. Equipped with plate mail (AC 3), lance, and sword. Morale 9.

### <a name="garrison"></a>Garrison

Patrols such as those described are only a small part of the ruler's garrison. Further forces may include magical monsters, or humans mounted on flying creatures.

### <a name="reaction"></a>Reaction

The reaction of the ruler to travellers in his or her domain depends on the class of the ruler, and can be determined by rolling 1d6 and consulting this table:

**d6** | **Arcane Caster** | **Divine Caster** | **Warrior**
1 | Chase | Chase | Chase
2 | Ignore | Chase | Chase
3 | Ignore | Ignore | Chase
4 | Ignore | Ignore | Ignore
5 | Ignore | Invite | Ignore
6 | Invite | Invite | Invite

**_Chase:_** The patrol is instructed to chase intruders out of the domain. Alternatively, they may demand a toll from travellers passing through. The exact price demanded depends on the ruler's character, the apparent wealth of the PCs, etc. If the PCs refuse to pay the toll, the patrol may attack them, drive them away, or attempt to take them prisoner.

**_Ignore:_** The patrol leaves the PCs to go about their business.

**_Invite:_** The patrol brings a message from the domain's ruler, inviting the PCs to stay in the stronghold. The ruler's exact motive for doing so will depend on his or her personality---it is not necessarily benign.

## <a name="npc_parties"></a>NPC Parties

This procedure generates parties of NPC adventurers. As the procedure is fairly involved, referees may wish to pre-generate some NPC parties for use in random encounters. The following general details apply to all types of NPC party described:

- **_Spells:_** If spell casters are present, choose or roll their memorized spells.
- **_Equipment:_** Normal adventuring gear.
- **_Treasure:_** Treasure types U+V, shared among the group.
- **_Marching order:_** Decided by referee.

If the classes presented in [**_B/X Essentials: Classes and Equipment_**](classes.md) are not in use, the referee should replace the listed classes by equivalents in use in his or her campaign.

### <a name="basic_adventurers"></a>Basic Adventurers

- **_Composition:_** 1d4+4 characters of random class and level (see below).
- **_Alignment:_** Either roll the alignment of each NPC or roll once for the party.

### <a name="expert_adventurers"></a>Expert Adventurers

- **_Composition:_** 1d6+3 characters of random class and level (see below).
- **_Alignment:_** Either roll the alignment of each NPC or roll once for the party.
- **_Mounts:_** 75% chance of being mounted, in the wilderness.
- **_Magic items:_** Per individual: there is a chance of the NPC having a magic item from each suitable magic item sub-table (see [**_Magic Items_**](#magic_items)). The chance per sub-table is 5% per level of the NPC. Rolled items that cannot be used by the NPC should be ignored (no re-roll).

### <a name="high_level_cleric"></a>High-Level Cleric

A high-level cleric and party. (Mounts and magic items as per Expert Adventurers.)

- **_Composition:_** Leader (cleric of level 1d6+6), 1d4 clerics (level 1d4+1), 1d3 fighters (level 1d6).
- **_Alignment:_** Roll for the whole party.

### <a name="high_level_fighter"></a>High-Level Fighter

A high-level fighter and a group of retainers, often on their way to or from war. (Mounts and magic items as per Expert Adventurers.)

- **_Composition:_** Leader (fighter of level 1d4+6), 2d4 retainers (level 1d4+2, any class).
- **_Alignment:_** Roll for the whole party.

### <a name="high_level_magic_user"></a>High-Level Magic-User

A high-level magic-user, accompanied by his or her apprentices and a group of hired guards, often on a quest for arcane lore. (Mounts and magic items as per Expert Adventurers.)

- **_Composition:_** Leader (magic-user of level 1d4+6), 1d4 apprentices (magic-users of level 1d3), 1d4 mercenaries (fighters of level 1d4+1).
- **_Alignment:_** Roll the leader's alignment. The apprentices have the same alignment as the leader, but the mercenaries may be of different alignment.

## <a name="placing_treasure"></a>Placing Treasure
There are two methods of deciding what treasure is in the possession of monsters encountered in an adventure, described below.

### <a name="rolling_randomly"></a>Rolling Randomly

Monster listings (for example in [**_B/X Essentials: Monsters_**](monsters.md)) note which treasure type is present in the creature's lair and which it may carry on its person. Each treasure type (described in the following section) lists one or more types of coin or item that may be found in the hoard. For each item in the list:

1. If a percentage value is given, roll d100 first. If the result is less than or equal to the listed percentage, this item is present in the hoard. If the result is greater than the listed percentage, this item is not present in the hoard.
2. If a range of values is given (e.g. 1d6 &times; 1,000cp, or 6d6 gems), roll the specified dice to determine the quantity of this item that is present in the hoard.
3. For gems, jewellery, and magic items, the procedures for determining the value and properties of the items in the hoard are found in later sections.

If the value of the randomly generated treasure is significantly above or below the average value of the treasure type, the referee may wish to adjust the results manually.

### <a name="referee_choice"></a>Referee Choice

As an alternative to rolling treasure at random, the referee may wish to choose treasures appropriate to the monsters and the player character party. As treasure is the main source of player character experience (see [**_Experience Points_**](core.md#experience_points))---usually accounting for 3/4 or more of their total experience earned---the referee should carefully consider treasure placement. The referee may use the following approach:

1. Consider the size of the adventuring party, the levels of the characters, and the XP requirements for them to advance.
2. Decide how many experience points the treasure hoard should provide, if the party successfully acquires it.
3. Place treasures whose total gold piece value matches the determined XP total.

When using this approach, the referee should ensure that the treasure is guarded by sufficiently powerful monsters. The player characters should have to earn this reward!

### <a name="items_of_value"></a>Items of Value

The treasure tables in the following sections describe methods for generating hoards of coins, gems, jewellery, and magic items. Adventures may often include valuable items of other kinds, however, whose worth may not always be obvious to players. The referee should feel free to include items such as the following in treasure hoards:

- **_Artwork:_** Paintings, statuary.
- **_Books:_** Rare tomes or scrolls.
- **_Foodstuffs:_** Spices, valuable wines.
- **_Furnishings:_** Rugs, tapestries, hangings.
- **_Utensils:_** Silver cutlery, unusual kitchen or laboratory implements.
- **_Valuables:_** Furs, ivory, ores, silks.

For each such item placed, the referee should note its value (in gold pieces) and (if using the optional rules for [**_Encumbrance_**](#core.md#encumbrance)) its weight.

## <a name="treasure_types"></a>Treasure Types

### <a name="hoards"></a>Hoards

These treasure types indicate the sum wealth of a large monster or a community of smaller monsters. Such hoards are usually hidden in the monsters' lair. For monsters with a lair encounter size of greater than 1d4, the amount of treasure in the hoard may be reduced, if the number of monsters is below average.

### <a name="average_values"></a>Average Values

The average value of each treasure type is listed alongside the letter code. These values sum the average results of gems, jewellery, and all types of coin. Magic items that the treasure type may indicate are not counted toward the average value, as magic items do not have fixed sale values.

>Author's Note: According to my re-calculation of these averages, there were errors in the original Basic rules. The average value for treasure type M, in particular, was way off.

### <a name="coin_conversion_rates"></a>Coin Conversion Rates

1pp = 5gp; 1gp = 2ep; 1gp = 10sp; 1gp = 100cp

## <a name="gems_and_jewellery"></a>Gems and Jewellery

### <a name="gems"></a>Gems

For each gem present in a treasure hoard, roll on the following table to determine its gold piece value:

#### <a name="gem_values"></a>Gem Values

d20 | Gem Value
----|----------
1-4 | 10gp
5-9 | 50gp
10-15 | 100gp
16-19 | 500gp
20 | 1,000gp

#### <a name="combining_gem_values"></a>Combining Gem Values

When a treasure type indicates the presence of multiple gems, the referee may combine the values of individual gems, as desired. For example, a roll of five 50gp value gems may be placed as a single 250gp gem, a 100gp gem and three 50gp gems, or any other combination.

### <a name="jewellery"></a>Jewellery

Each piece of jewellery indicated by a treasure type is worth 3d6 &times; 100gp. (For characters of 4th level and above, the referee may decide to place pieces of jewellery of even greater value.)

#### <a name="combining_jewellery_values"></a>Combining Jewellery Values

As with gems (see above), the referee may combine the values of individual pieces of jewellery, as desired.

#### <a name="damaged_jewellery"></a>Damaged Jewellery

Rough treatment of jewellery (for example crushing, intense heat or fire, lightning) can damage it, reducing its value by 50%.

## <a name="magic_items"></a>Magic Items

### <a name="rolling_magic_items"></a>Rolling Magic Items

If a treasure type indicates a specific type of magic item (e.g. 3 potions), roll on the table for that type of item (see below). Otherwise, first roll on the Magic Item Type table to determine the type of the item, then roll on the table for that type.

### <a name="basic_and_expert_magic_items"></a>Basic and Expert Magic Items

Separate probabilities are listed in each table for Basic and Expert level characters (i.e. characters of 1st to 3rd level, and characters of 4th level or higher). The Basic probabilities are listed in the B column, and the Expert probabilities in the X column.
It is recommended that the probabilities appropriate to the group's experience level be used. Alternatively, if the referee prefers to have an even distribution of magic items, irrespective of player character level, the Expert probabilities may always be used.

### <a name="magic_item_type"></a>Magic Item Type

B: d% | X: d% | Type of Item
------|-------|-------------
1-10 | 1-10 | Armour
11-15 | 11-15 | Misc. Item
16-40 | 16-35 | Potion
41-45 | 36-40 | Rin
46-65 | 41-70 | Scroll or Map
66-85 | 71-90 | Sword
86-90 | 91-95 | Wand/Staff/Rod
91-00 | 96-00 | Weapon

### <a name="identifying_magic_items"></a>Identifying Magic Items

- **_Testing:_** The most common way of identifying magic items is by trial and error---sipping a potion, donning a suit of armour, using a weapon in battle, etc.
- **_Retainers:_** Players may wish to use retainers as "guinea pigs" to test magic items of unknown properties. Retainers may agree to do this, but only if allowed to keep the item in question.
- **_By magic:_** High-level NPC magic-users may also be able to identify magic items. They will always require payment or a service in kind. The process takes time: possibly several weeks.

### <a name="using_magic_items"></a>Using Magic Items

- **_Appropriate use:_** In order to be effective, a magic item must be used, held, or worn in the normal fashion.
- **_Concentration:_** To activate an item's magic, the user must concentrate on its effect. When using a magic item in this way, the character cannot take any other actions.
- **_Items that are always active:_** The following types of item are always active, and do not require concentration: magic weapons, armour, and protective items (e.g. ring of protection, elven cloak).
- **_Actions per round:_** A magic item's effect can normally only be used once per round, unless its description notes otherwise.

### <a name="wishes"></a>Wishes

Several magic items grant wishes, the powerful ability for a character to change the nature of reality in any conceivable way that he or she should desire. Wishes are generally regarded as the most powerful magic in the game, and have the potential to greatly upset the balance of play, if not handled carefully by the referee. The following guidelines may be used:

- **_Wording:_** The player and referee must pay great attention to the precise wording of a wish.
- **_World-changing wishes:_** A wish that would alter some fundamental aspect of the game or the campaign world will have no effect. For example, a wish that altered the abilities of all monsters of a particular type would fail.
- **_Greedy wishes:_** A wish that the referee judges to be unreasonable or overly greedy may come to pass, but with its intent twisted in some way. For example, a wish for a very powerful magic item may cause the item to appear, but in the possession of a dangerous enemy.
- **_Wishing for more wishes:_** Results in an infinite time loop, putting the character out of play.

Some examples of reasonable wishes:

- Wishing for a weapon to help fight magical monsters. The wish may grant a sword +1 that vanishes when the combat ends.
- Wishing that a monster had not attacked. The wish may place the characters back in time and change the reaction of the monster.
- Wishing that a deadly blow had not occurred. The affected character may return to life, wounded but not dead.

## <a name="armour"></a>Armour

B: d4 | X: d% | Item
------|-------|-----
1 | 1-15 | Armour +1
2 | 16-25 | Armour +1, Shield +1

 | 86-95 | Shield +2
 | 96-00 | Shield +3

### <a name="type_of_armour"></a>Type of Armour

The referee may choose the type of armour in a treasure hoard, or may roll on the following table:

d8 | Type of Armour
---|---------------
1-2 | Leather
3-6 | Chainmail
7-8 | Plate mail

### <a name="enchanted_armour_and_shields"></a>Enchanted Armour and Shields

- **_AC bonus:_** The associated bonus improves the wearer's Armour Class rating. For example, a suit of chainmail +1 grants a base Armour Class of 4, one point better than the AC 5 of non-magical chainmail.
- **_Weight:_** When using [option 2 of the encumbrance rules](core.md#encumbrance_by_weight), the enchanted armour's encumbrance value is 50% less than that of normal armour.

### <a name="cursed_armour_and_shields"></a>Cursed Armour and Shields

- **_AC penalty:_** Some types of cursed armour specify an Armour Class penalty. This modifier worsens the wearer's Armour Class rating. For example, a cursed suit of chainmail -1 grants a base Armour Class of 6, one point worse than the AC 5 of non-magical chainmail.
- **_AC 9:_** Some types of cursed armour give the wearer a base Armour Class of 9 (before modifiers due to Dexterity).
- **_Testing:_** All types of tests indicate that a cursed shield or suit of armour is enchanted with a +1 bonus. It is only when the armour is used in deadly combat that the curse is revealed.

- The wearer may teleport him- or herself, another creature, or an object.
- If used on another creature or object, a **save vs spells** is allowed to resist.
- The helm's power is usable only once. To be used again, a _teleport_ spell must be cast upon it.

- Creatures within a 100' long cone (20' wide at the end) suffer 2d6 damage.
- Affected creatures are also deafened for one turn (**save vs spells** to avoid).
- At the referee's discretion, the horn may also be able to damage objects and buildings (e.g. a single blast might be enough to destroy a simple cottage; a 10' section of castle wall might require three blasts).

#### <a name="medallion_of_esp_30"></a>Medallion of ESP 30'

A medallion on a chain, enchanted with the power of reading thoughts.

- By concentrating for 1 round, the wearer may target a creature within 30'.
- At the referee's option, the target may **save vs spells** to resist.
- While reading thoughts, the wearer may move, but cannot cast spells or attack.

#### <a name="medallion_of_esp_90"></a>Medallion of ESP 90'

A medallion on a chain, enchanted with the power of reading thoughts. This works in the same way as the magic-user spell _ESP_ (see [**_B/X Essentials: Cleric and Magic-User Spells_**](spells.md)).

A mirror with the ability to magically trap living creatures behind its pane.

### <a name="cursed_scrolls"></a>Cursed Scrolls

- Merely looking at the baneful script on the scroll curses the character.
- The referee should determine the nature of the curse (see examples below).
- The curse can be removed by magic (e.g. _remove curse_), or (at the referee's option) by performing a special quest.

#### <a name="example_curses"></a>Example Curses

1. The reader is transformed into a harmless creature (e.g. a frog).
2. A wandering monster appears next to the reader and attacks (gaining surprise). The monster is of equal level to the reader.
3. A magic item in the reader's possession vanishes. The referee may select the item or choose it at random.
4. The reader permanently loses one experience level (or Hit Die). This incurs a loss of one Hit Die of hit points, as well as all other benefits due to the lost level (e.g. spells, saving throws, etc.). A character's XP is reduced to halfway between the former and new levels. A person who loses all levels dies.
5. The player must re-roll the character's prime requisite.
6. The reader's healing capacity is reduced. Natural healing takes double the normal amount of time, and healing spells only cure half the normal number of hit points.

### <a name="protection_scrolls"></a>Protection Scrolls

Enchanted script that conjures a circle of protection, effective against a specific type of monster or energy.

- Written in non-magical languages (usually Common); usable by all characters.
- When used, conjures a 10' radius circle of protection around the reader.
- If the reader moves, the circle of protection follows him or her.
- For scrolls of protection against monsters: the circle does not prevent affected monsters from using magic or missile attacks against those within it. If anyone within the circle attacks an affected monster in melee, the circle is broken.

#### <a name="protection_from_elementals"></a>Protection from Elementals

- No elemental may enter the circle.
- Lasts for 2 turns, unless broken.

#### <a name="protection_from_lycanthropes"></a>Protection from Lycanthropes

- A number of lycanthropes are barred from entering the circle. The number depends on their Hit Dice: 1-3 HD: 1d10 lycanthropes affected, 4-5 HD: 1d8 affected, 6+ HD: 1d4 affected.
- Lasts for 6 turns, unless broken.

#### <a name="protection_from_magic"></a>Protection from Magic

- Conjures a barrier that spells and spell-like effects (e.g. from magic items) cannot cross.
- The barrier prevents magic from entering the circle, but also from leaving it.
- Last for 1d4 turns.
- Can only be broken by a _wish_.

#### <a name="protection_from_undead"></a>Protection from Undead

- A number of undead monsters are barred from entering the circle of protection. The number depends on their Hit Dice: 1-3 HD: 2d12 undead affected, 4-5 HD: 2d6 undead affected, 6+ HD: 1d6 undead affected.
- Lasts for 6 turns, unless broken.

### <a name="spell_scrolls"></a>Spell Scrolls
Sheets of paper, parchment, papyrus, etc. on which one or more magic spells have been written by a spell caster. 1-in-4 spell scrolls contain divine spells; the rest contain arcane spells.

Casting spells from scrolls works as follows:

- Only arcane spell casters can use scrolls of arcane spells. Only divine spell casters can use scrolls of divine spells.
- The words on the scroll must be read out loud.
- When a spell is cast, the inscription disappears from the scroll. (If a scroll contains multiple spells, only the spell cast disappears.)
- Arcane spells are written in magical script that can only be read by magic (e.g. the _read magic_ spell, see [**_B/X Essentials: Cleric and Magic-User Spells_**](spells.md)).
- Divine spells are written in normal languages (usually Common), but can only be used by divine spell casters.

The referee may choose the spells on a scroll, or may roll for them randomly. The following table may be used to randomly select the level of each spell on a scroll.

B: d6 | X: d% | Spell Level
------|-------|------------
1-3 | 1-25 | 1st
4-5 | 26-50 | 2nd
6 | 51-70 | 3rd
 | 71-85 | 4th
 | 86-95 | 5th
 | 96-00 | 6th*

\* _Re-roll for divine spells._

### <a name="treasure_maps"></a>Treasure Maps

Directions to the location of a valuable treasure. Usable by any character.

- Indicates the route to the indicated treasure, located in a dungeon or wilderness.
- The map may not always be easy to interpret: it may be incomplete, worded in riddles, or written in an obscure language.
- For treasures with a listed gold piece value, the referee may choose what type of treasure is in the hoard. (For example, it may be coins, but could also consist of valuable art objects or jewels.)
- The treasure is normally guarded by enchantments, traps, or monsters (e.g. a monster from the [**_Dungeon Encounter Tables_**](#dungeon_encounter_tables) of levels 5-6, or higher).
- The referee should prepare treasure maps in advance.

#### <a name="types_of_treasure_map"></a>Types of Treasure Map

### <a name="cursed_swords"></a>Cursed Swords

- **_Penalty:_** The associated penalty is applied to both attack rolls and damage rolls made with the sword.
- **_Discarding:_** Once the sword has been used in combat, the character comes under the curse and is not able to discard the item. In fact, they will favour the sword and use it whenever possible. The curse can only be removed with magic (e.g. _remove curse_ or _dispel evil_).

### <a name="enchanted_swords"></a>Enchanted Swords

- **_Bonus:_** The associated bonus is applied to both attack rolls and damage rolls made with the sword.
- **_Bonus vs creature type:_** Some swords have a special bonus when used against a certain type of creature.
- **_Sentience:_** Some magic swords have an innate intelligence and personality, along with other special powers. If the referee wishes to randomly determine whether a magic sword is intelligent, the probability is 30%. See [**_Sentient Swords_**](#sentient_swords), for rules for determining the special powers of a sentient sword.
- **_Special purpose:_** There is additionally a 1-in-20 chance of a magic sword having been imbued with a special purpose. Such swords are extremely powerful and are always sentient. See [**_Sentient Swords_**](#sentient_swords), for rules for determining the powers of a sword of special purpose. The referee may choose to only place such swords by design, rather than rolling this chance randomly.

### <a name="sword_descriptions"></a>Sword Descriptions

#### <a name="sword_energy_drain"></a>Sword +1, Energy Drain

Drains the life energy of its victims.

- On a successful hit, the wielder may command the sword to drain the victim's life energy.
- In this case, in addition to suffering normal damage, the target permanently loses one experience level (or Hit Die). This incurs a loss of one Hit Die of hit points, as well as all other benefits due to the drained level (e.g. spells, saving throws, etc.). A character's XP is reduced to the lowest amount for the new level. A person drained of all levels dies.
- The sword may drain a total of 1d4+4 levels. Once this many levels have been drained, it becomes a normal magical sword +1.

#### <a name="sword_flaming"></a>Sword +1, Flaming

#### <a name="sword_locate_objects"></a>Sword +1, Locate Objects

Grants the wielder the ability to detect the presence of objects within 120', once per day. This works in the same way as the magic-user spell _locate object_ (see [**_B/X Essentials: Cleric and Magic-User Spells_**](spells.md)).

### <a name="charges"></a>Charges

Rods, staves, and wands have a limited number of uses, called "charges".

- The number of charges in the item when discovered is determined by the referee.
- It is not possible for characters to discover the number of charges in an item.

**_Animals:_**

- Affects 1d6 normal animals or 1 giant animal (but not magical or intelligent animals).
- No saving throw is allowed.
- Controlling animals requires line of sight and concentration (which is broken if the user of the staff moves or attacks).

- This power of the staff may be used up to once per turn.

**_Humans:_**

- A charm may be placed upon one human per round. The subject may **save vs spells (with a -2 penalty)** to resist the charm.
- Up to 6 Hit Dice of humans may be charmed in this way. Normal humans count for 1/2 HD.
- A charmed individual regards the character as a trusted friend, and will come to his or her defence. He or she will obey the character's commands, as long as these are not obviously harmful and do not contradict the subject's alignment. Charmed individuals cannot cast spells.

A magical quarterstaff that has the power to transform into a snake, on command.

- Usable by divine spell casters only.
- Treated as a quarterstaff, in melee. Gains a +1 magic bonus to attacks and damage.
- On a successful hit upon a human-sized (or smaller) creature, the wielder of the staff may speak the command word, causing it to transform into a serpent and coil around the victim.
- The victim must **save vs spells** or be immobilised in the coils of the snake. Immobilised victims are completely helpless while held by the snake (1d4 turns, or released as the wielder of the staff commands).
- The snake has AC 5, HD 3 (20hp), and a movement rate of 60' (20').
- When the victim is released, the snake returns to the owner and transforms back into a staff. (At this point, it is healed of any damage it has suffered.)

- **_Whirlwind:_** Conjures a whirlwind 70' tall, 20' wide at the top, and 10' wide at the base. The whirlwind lasts for 3 rounds, and moves at 120' (40'), as the wielder of the staff directs. All in its path suffer 2d6 damage. Creatures with less than 2HD are swept aside (**save vs death** to avoid).
- **_Sacrifice:_** The wielder may sacrifice the staff by breaking it in two. Doing so unleashes a 30' radius fireball that inflicts 8 points of damage per remaining charge in the staff. The wielder of the staff also suffers this damage.

>Author's note: The exact nature of this staff's whirlwind power is not clear in the original Expert rules. I have specified a duration of 3 rounds, based on the pillar of flame effect of the efreeti monster.

- Concentration is required to maintain the illusion: the wielder of the wand may move at up to half normal movement rate while concentrating. Concentration is broken if the wielder attacks or casts a spell, or if he or she is successfully attacked (damaged, targeted by a malicious spell, etc).

#### <a name="wand_of_lightning_bolts"></a>Wand of Lightning Bolts

## <a name="sentient_swords"></a>Sentient Swords

Some magic swords possess sentience (see [**_Swords_**](#swords) for the chances of this).

- Sentient swords are intelligent and have a personality of their own. The referee should play them as NPCs.
- Sentient swords have special powers, in addition to their normal enchantment.
- The procedure for designing a sentient sword is given below. Instead of rolling the sword's qualities randomly, the referee may select them as desired.

### <a name="rolling_a_sentient_sword"></a>Rolling a Sentient Sword

1. **_Special purpose:_** If the sword is imbued with a special purpose (see [**_Swords_**](#swords)), its nature should be determined. See [**_Special Purpose_**](#special_purpose), later.
2. **_Intelligence:_** The sword's INT is 1d6+6. Swords imbued with a special purpose always have INT 12.

### <a name="using_a_sentient_sword"></a>Using a Sentient Sword

Sentient swords grant the wielder special powers beyond those of a normal magic sword, but using such an item also carries certain risks.

### <a name="activating_powers"></a>Activating Powers

- To use a power, the sword must be in the wielder's hand.
- The wielder must concentrate to activate a power.

### <a name="alignment"></a>Alignment

The alignment of the sword can only be determined by touching it. Doing so may incur damage, if the character is of a different alignment to the sword:

- **_Lawful swords:_** Inflict 1d6 damage per round to Neutral characters, and 2d6 per round to Chaotic characters.
- **_Neutral swords:_** Inflict 1d6 damage per round to non-Neutral characters.
- **_Chaotic swords:_** Inflict 1d6 damage per round to Neutral characters, and 2d6 per round to Lawful characters.

### <a name="control"></a>Control

A sentient sword has its own personality, and can, at times, attempt to exercise control over the person who wields it. A control check (see below) is triggered in any of the following circumstances:

- **_First contact:_** Upon the character first touching the sword.
- **_Wounded:_** When the character is reduced to half hit points or less.
- **_Jealousy:_** When another magic weapon comes into the character's possession.
- **_Alignment difference:_** Upon every use, if the sword and the character are of different alignments.
- **_Special purpose:_** If the sword has a special purpose: every time the special purpose is applicable. (e.g. when encountering a character or creature of the type the sword is designed to slay.)

#### <a name="control_checks"></a>Control Checks

When one of the aforementioned circumstances occurs, a control check is required:

1. Determine the sword's Will score:
    a. The sum of its INT and Ego.
    b. Plus one for each extraordinary power the sword has.
    c. Plus 1d10, if the sword and the wielder of are different alignments.

2. Determine the wielder's Will score:
    a. The sum of STR and WIS scores.
    b. If the character has less than full hit points, Will is reduced by 1d4 (or 2d4, if the character has less than half hit points).

3. Compare the Will scores. If the sword's Will score is higher, it takes control of the character's actions.

#### <a name="when_the_sword_takes_control"></a>When the Sword Takes Control

The referee determines the behaviour of the character, via the sword, for example:

- Discarding other weapons, or ignoring newly discovered magic weapons.
- Charging into battle, to gain glory for the sword.
- Surrendering to a foe whom the sword deems either more worthy of possessing it or more susceptible to being controlled.
- Making lavish expenditures for the sword: purchasing expensive sheaths, having jewels fitted, having enchantments and wards applied, etc. The sword may force the character to spend most of his or her money on such things!

#### <a name="when_control_ends"></a>When Control Ends

Once in control, the sword will only release the character when the circumstance that triggered the control check is over, or when the sword is otherwise satisfied.
