From Gavin:

>My love for Basic/Expert-style fantasy adventuring was reignited with the publication of Labyrinth Lord and the rise of the old-school renaissance whatever-you-like-to-call-it. Over the years, I’ve run all sorts of campaigns with the Basic/Expert rules—everything from classic dungeon hacks, to dying Earth science fantasy, to Lovecraft-inspired, Victorian age horror. Of course, all these campaigns have added their own twists to the rules: alternate classes, new spells, monsters, equipment, treasures, and so on. Nonetheless, the core rules of the game remained constant. And I think that’s the real treasure of the Basic/Expert rules: their timeless elegance, concision, and very wide (I wouldn’t go quite so far as to say universal) applicability.
>
>Through all these years of play, though, what I’ve always missed is a cleanly presented, easy-to-reference rendition of the core rules of the game separated from the associated “accoutrements”—the classes, spells, monsters, magic items, etc. Neither the original Basic/Expert books nor the various modern clones exactly satisfy this requirement.
>
>That’s what this book is about.
>
>We are very fortunate that the original Basic/Expert rules are now available to purchase again (albeit in PDF form only) and, while they are inspiring in their brevity and the elegance of their layout, they are built around the assumed presence of the traditional set of classes, thus not exactly what I was looking for. Furthermore, one has to contend with the nature of the presentation: the Basic rules are separated from the Expert rules. No combined edition was ever created.
>
>All of the various retro-clones and Basic/Expert-inspired games which exist today, on the other hand, present a combined rule set, but vary greatly in readability and usefulness as a reference during play. Some provide a very clean presentation of the rules, with a focus on usability, but deviate in too many ways from the traditional rule set to make them useful.
>
>Eventually, not finding my holy grail Basic/Expert reference anywhere, I was inspired to create this book. So, what you will find in these pages is a rules reference for the combined Basic/Expert game.
>
>My primary goal in writing this book has been to present a streamlined rendition of the Basic/Expert rules, optimised for easy reference. To this end, information that is scattered throughout the original rule books has been carefully collated. For example, all the information pertaining to each character class is presented in one place, on a single page or spread. (This includes the attack and saving throw charts.) No more page-flipping is required to get an overview of a character’s abilities.
>
>During the research and writing of this book, I noticed (indeed, for the first time!) that there are ambiguities, omissions, and even contradictions in several areas of the original Expert rules. The rules for water vessels and stronghold construction are especially bad, in this regard. As one of the aims of the B/X Essentials line is the presentation of a clarified rule set, I did not feel comfortable simply presenting these ambiguous and contradictory rules “as-is”. The rules you will find in this book thus contain my own slight reworkings, in an attempt to resolve the problems present in the original books. While I have made a great effort to update these rules in a sensible and consistent way, cleaving as closely as possible to the original rules, other interpretations and untanglings of the original rules are certainly possible.
