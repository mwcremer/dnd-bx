### <a name="roll_ability_scores"></a>1. Roll Ability Scores

Character ability scores are determined by rolling randomly. Roll 3d6 for your character's Charisma, Constitution, Dexterity, Intelligence, Strength, and Wisdom. See [**_Ability Scores_**](#ability_scores).

#### <a name="sub_par_characters"></a>Sub-Par Characters

If you roll a character with very poor ability scores---for example an 8 or less in every score or an extremely low rating in one ability---the referee may sometimes allow you to discard the character and start again.

### <a name="choose_a_class"></a>2. Choose a Class

Select one of the classes available (see [**_Character Classes_**](#character_classes)), bearing in mind the minimum ability score requirements of some classes.

### <a name="adjust_ability_scores"></a>3. Adjust Ability Scores

Optionally, the prime requisite(s) of your character (determined by the chosen class) may be raised by lowering other (non-prime requisite) ability scores. For every two points by which an ability score is reduced, one point may be added to your prime requisite. The following restrictions apply:

- Only Intelligence, Strength, and Wisdom may be lowered in this way.
- No score may be lowered below 9.
- Some classes may have extra constraints.

### <a name="note_ability_score_modifiers"></a>4. Note Ability Score Modifiers

Now that your character's ability scores are fixed, make a note of any associated bonuses or penalties, consulting the charts in [**_Ability Scores_**](#ability_scores).

### <a name="note_attack_values"></a>5. Note Attack Values

The level progression chart for your character's class lists the modified attack roll needed to hit an opponent with Armour Class 0. The attack roll you need to hit opponents of other AC ratings can be calculated from this value by subtracting the target AC from the value to hit AC 0.

For example, a character who needs a 17 to hit AC 0 could hit AC 5 on a roll of 12 or greater (17 - 5 = 12).

It is usual to pre-calculate the modified attack values required to hit AC 0-9 and record them in a matrix. 1st level characters need to roll a 19 to hit AC 0, resulting in an attack matrix like this:

Opponent's AC        |  0 |  1 |  2 |  3 |  4 |  5 |  6 |  7 |  8 |  9
---------------------|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----
Attack roll required | 19 | 18 | 17 | 16 | 15 | 14 | 13 | 12 | 11 | 10

### <a name="note_saving_throws_and_class_abilities"></a>6. Note Saving Throws and Class Abilities

Record any special abilities possessed by your character as a result of his or her class, as well as your character's saving throws. If your character has a spell book, ask your referee which spells are recorded in it. The referee may allow you to choose.

### <a name="roll_hit_points"></a>7. Roll Hit Points

Determine your character's hit points by rolling the die type appropriate to the chosen class. Modifiers for high or low Constitution apply (see [**_Ability Scores_**](#ability_scores)). Your character always starts with at least 1 hit point, regardless of CON modifier.

#### <a name="re_rolling_1s_and_2s"></a>Re-Rolling 1s and 2s (Optional Rule)

If your roll for hit points comes up 1 or 2 (_before_ applying any CON modifier), the referee may allow you to re-roll. This is in order to increase the survivability of 1st level PCs.

### <a name="choose_alignment"></a>8. Choose Alignment

Decide whether your character is Lawful, Neutral, or Chaotic (see [**_Alignment_**](#alignment)) and note this on your character sheet.

### <a name="note_known_languages"></a>9. Note Known Languages

Every character begins play knowing one or more languages, determined by the character's class. Characters with high Intelligence may also choose additional languages. See [**_Languages_**](#languages) for a list of possibilities.

### <a name="buy_equipment"></a>10. Buy Equipment

Your character starts play with 3d6 &times; 10 gold pieces (see [**_Money and Wealth_**](#money_and_wealth)). You may spend as much of this money as you wish to equip your character for adventure, consulting the lists in [**_Equipment_**](#equipment), [**_Land Transportation_**](#land_transportation), and [**_Water Transportation_**](#water_transportation).

Remember that your chosen class may restrict your use of some equipment (e.g. weapons and armour).

### <a name="note_armour_class"></a>11. Note Armour Class

Your character's Armour Class is determined by two factors:

- The armour worn (see [**_Armour_**](#armour) in [**_Equipment_**](#equipment)). If your character has no armour, his or her base AC is 9.
- Modifiers for high or low Dexterity (see [**_Ability Scores_**](#ability_scores)).

### <a name="name_character"></a>12. Name Character

Finally, choose a name for your character. You are now ready for adventure!

6-8 | -1
9-12 | None
13-15 | +1
16-17 | +2
18 | +3

### <a name="cha"></a>Charisma

Charisma (CHA) measures a character's force of personality, persuasiveness, personal magnetism, physical attractiveness, and ability to lead. This ability is important for how NPCs or monsters will respond to a character in an encounter. Charisma also determines the number of retainers a character may have and their morale.

- **_Reaction Adjustment_** applies when hiring Retainers and when interacting with monsters (see [**_Encounters_**](#encounters)).

- **_Max # of Retainers_** and **_Retainer Morale_** determine the number of [**_Retainers_**](#retainers) a character may have in his or her pay at any one time and their loyalty to the character.

CHA | Reaction Adjustment | Max # of Retainers | Retainer Morale
--|----|---|---
3 | -2 | 1 | 4
4-5 | -1 | 2 | 5

### <a name="con"></a>Constitution

Constitution (CON) represents a character's health and stamina. A Constitution bonus increases a character's hit points, making this ability important for all classes.

- [**_Standard Adjustment_**](#standard_adjustment) applies when rolling a character's hit points (i.e. at 1st level and every time a level is gained thereafter). A character always gains at least 1 hit point per Hit Die, regardless of CON modifier.

### <a name="dex"></a>Dexterity

Dexterity (DEX) measures hand-eye coordination, agility, reflexes, and balance. This ability is important for combat-oriented classes, as it affects Armour Class, and for characters who focus on missile combat.

- [**_Standard Adjustment_**](#standard_adjustment) is applied to attack rolls (but not damage rolls) made with a ranged weapon and modifies the character's Armour Class (a bonus lowers AC, a penalty raises it).

- **_Initiative Adjustment_** modifies the character's initiative roll, if the optional rule for individual initiative is being used (see [**_Basic Combat Procedure_**](core.md#basic_combat_procedure)).

DEX | Initiative Adjustment
--|---
3 | -2
4-5 | -1
6-8 | -1
9-12 | None
13-15 | +1
16-17 | +1
18 | +2

### <a name="int"></a>Intelligence

Intelligence (INT) determines how well a character learns, remembers, and reasons.

- **_Language Ability_** denotes the character's ability to speak, read, and write in his or her native tongue and other languages.

- **_Bonus Languages_** determines the number of additional languages the character can choose during character creation.

INT | Language Ability | Bonus Languages
--|--|--
3 | Unable to read or write, broken speech | 0
4-5 | Unable to read or write | 0
6-8 | Can write simple words | 0
9-12 | Can read and write native languages | 0
13-15 | Can read and write native languages | 1
16-17 | Can read and write native languages | 2
18 | Can read and write native languages | 3

### <a name="str"></a>Strength

Strength (STR) rates a character's brawn, muscle, and physical power. This ability is especially important for characters who focus on melee combat.

- [**_Standard Adjustment_**](#standard_adjustment) is applied to attack and damage rolls with melee weapons and to attempts to force open a stuck door (see [**_Doors_**](core.md#doors)).

### <a name="wis"></a>Wisdom

Wisdom (WIS) encompasses a character's willpower, common sense, perception, and intuition. While Intelligence represents one's ability to analyse information, Wisdom represents being in tune with and aware of one's surroundings.

- [**_Standard Adjustment_**](#standard_adjustment) is applied to saving throws versus magical effects. This normally does not include saves against breath attacks, but may apply to any other saving throw category.

### <a name="prime_requisite"></a>Prime Requisite

Each character class has one or more prime requisites, that is, an ability score or scores that are of especial importance to characters of that class. A character's score in his or her class' prime requisite(s) affects how quickly the character is able to gain experience points.

- **_XP Adjustment_** is applied to all experience points awarded to the character, unless otherwise noted in the description of the class.

Score | XP Adjustment
--|--
3-5 | -20%
6-8 | -10%
9-12 | None
13-15 | +5%
16-18 | +10%

### <a name="cleric"></a>Cleric

Requirements: None  
Prime Requisite: WIS  
Hit Dice: 1d6  
Maximum Level: 14  
Allowed Armour: Any, including shields  
Allowed Weapons: Any blunt weapons  
Languages: Alignment language, Common

Clerics are humans who have sworn to serve a deity. They conduct their lives in a way to further the will of their deity and channel the power of their deity. Clerics are trained for combat; they should be thought of as fighting holy crusaders, not as passive priests.

**_Holy Symbol:_** A cleric must carry a holy symbol (see [**_Equipment_**](#equipment)).

**_Deity Disfavour:_** If a cleric ever falls from favour, due to violating the beliefs or strictures of his or her deity or clergy, penalties (determined by the referee) may be imposed upon the cleric. These may include penalties to attack (-1) or even a reduction in spells.

#### <a name="cleric_abilities"></a>Abilities

**_Combat:_** Clerics can use any form of armour, but strict holy doctrine prevents their use of weapons that have a sharp edge. Thus, only the following weapons from the standard lists in [**_Equipment_**](#equipment) may be used: club, mace, sling, staff, warhammer.

**_Magical Research:_** A cleric of any level may spend time and money to research new spells associated with his or her deity. When a cleric reaches 9th level, he or she is also able to create magic items and research other magical effects. These rules are detailed in [Magical Research](core.md#magical_research).

**_Spell Casting:_** From 2nd level, a cleric may pray to receive spells from his or her deity. The power and number of spells available to a cleric are determined by the character's experience level. The rules for divine spell casting are found in [Casting a Spell](core.md#casting_a_spell). The list of spells available to clerics is found in [Cleric Spell List](spells.md#cleric_spell_list).

**_Turning the Undead:_** Clerics are able to call upon the name and power of their deity to repel or even destroy undead. This ability is known as _turning the undead_. The chart below lists a dash, a "T", a "D", or a number corresponding to the Hit Dice of an undead creature and the level of the cleric:

- A dash means an automatic failure.
- A number indicates that the player must roll that number or higher on 2d6 in order to successfully turn the undead.
- A "T" means that the turning automatically succeeds for this type of undead.
- A "D" means that the turning automatically succeeds for this type of undead and that the monsters are destroyed, not simply caused to flee.

If the turning attempt succeeds, the player rolls 2d6 to determine the number of Hit Dice of undead affected (either turned or destroyed). No matter what the dice roll result, at least one undead creature will always be turned or destroyed, as appropriate, on a successful turning. Turned undead will leave the area, if possible, and will not harm or make contact with the cleric.

If _turn undead_ is used against a mixed group of undead monsters of different types, those with the lowest HD are affected first.

**_Using Magic Items:_** As spell casters, clerics can use magic scrolls of spells on their spell list. There are also items (e.g. some staves) that only clerics can use.

#### <a name="cleric_reaching_9th_level"></a>Reaching 9th Level

Once attaining 9th level, a cleric may establish or build a stronghold. So long as the cleric is currently in favour with his or her god, a stronghold may be bought or built at half the normal price, due to divine intervention.

Once a stronghold is established, the cleric will attract followers (5d6 &times; 10 fighters of 1st or 2nd level). These troops are completely devoted to the cleric (never checking morale). The referee chooses which proportions of followers are 1st and 2nd level and which are bowmen, infantry, etc.

### <a name="dwarf"></a>Dwarf

Requirements: Minimum CON 9  
Prime Requisite: STR  
Hit Dice: 1d8  
Maximum Level: 12  
Allowed Armour: Any, including shields  
Allowed Weapons: Small or normal sized (see below)  
Languages: Alignment language, Common, dwarvish, gnome, goblin, kobold

Dwarves are stout, bearded demi-humans who average a height of approximately 4 feet and weigh about 150 pounds. Dwarves live underground and value precious metals, fine craftsmanship, and stones. Perhaps not surprisingly, they have skin, hair, and eye colours in earth tones. Dwarves have a reputation for having surly attitudes and are particularly gruff with elves. Dwarves are particularly hardy people and have a strong resistance to magic, as reflected in their saving throws.

#### <a name="dwarf_abilities"></a>Abilities

**_Combat:_** Dwarves may use any type of armour, however, due to their short height, may only use small or normal sized weapons. This means that dwarves cannot use longbows or two-handed swords.

**_Detect Construction Tricks:_** From their experience underground, dwarves have a 2-in-6 chance of detecting false walls, hidden construction, or sloping passages. A dwarf must be actively searching for these abilities to function.

**_Detect Traps:_** Due to their expertise with construction, dwarves have a 2-in-6 chance of detecting non-magical traps, when searching (see [**_Searching_**](core.md#searching)).

**_Infravision:_** Due to their habit of living underground in great mines, dwarves have the ability to see in the dark with infravision up to 60' (see [**_Light, Vision, and Visibility_**](core.md#light_vision_and_visibility)).

**_Listening at Doors:_** Dwarves have a 2-in-6 chance of hearing noises (see [**_Doors_**](core.md#doors)).

#### <a name="dwarf_reaching_9th_level"></a>Reaching 9th Level

When a dwarf reaches level 9, he or she has the option of creating an underground stronghold that will attract dwarves from far and wide. Dwarves usually live in clans, so dwarves of the character's clan will be attracted to live under his or her roof. Dwarves from other clans will also come and live nearby to be ruled by the character. A dwarf ruler is able to hire dwarven soldiers or mercenaries, but may only hire members of other races for other tasks, such as human alchemists or elves for spell casting.

### <a name="elf"></a>Elf

Requirements: Minimum INT 9  
Prime Requisite: INT and STR  
Hit Dice: 1d6  
Maximum Level: 10  
Allowed Armour: Any, including shields  
Allowed Weapons: Any  
Languages: Alignment language, Common, elvish, gnoll, hobgoblin, and orcish

Elves are slender, fey demi-humans with pointed ears. They are very diverse in appearance, much like humans, and there are said to be different kinds of elves in distant locations. They typically weigh about 120 pounds and are between 5 and 5 1/2 feet tall. Though a peaceful people who enjoy good, light food and play, elves are very talented fighters and users of magic.

**_Prime Requisites:_** An elf must have at least 13 in both prime requisites in order to get the +5% bonus to experience. An elf with an INT of at least 16 and a STR of at least 13 receives a +10% XP bonus.

#### <a name="elf_abilities"></a>Abilities

**_Combat:_** Elves are able to use all forms of weapon and armour.

**_Detect Secret Doors:_** Elves have keen eyes that allow them, when actively searching, to detect hidden and secret doors with a 2-in-6 chance (see [**_Searching_**](core.md#searching)).

**_Immunity to Ghoul Paralysis:_** Elves are completely unaffected by the paralysis ghouls can inflict.

**_Infravision:_** Elves have infravision to 60' (see [**_Light, Vision, and Visibility_**](core.md#light_vision_and_visibility)).

**_Listening at Doors:_** Elves have a 2-in-6 chance of hearing noises (see [**_Doors_**](core.md#doors)).

**_Magical Research:_** An elf of any level may spend time and money to research new spells to add to his or her spell book. When an elf reaches 9th level, he or she is also able to create magic items and research other magical effects. These rules are detailed in [**_Magic_**](core.md#magic) section.

**_Spell Casting:_** Elves carry spell books that hold the formulae for arcane spells written on their pages. An elf can only memorize a certain number of spells at any given time. The spell casting chart (below) shows both the number of spells in the elf's spell book and the number he or she may memorize, determined by the character's experience level. Thus, a 1st level elf has one spell in his or her spell book, selected by the referee (who may allow the player to choose). The rules for arcane spell casting and spell books are described in the [**_Magic_**](core.md#magic) section. The list of spells available to elves is provided in [**Magic-User Spell List_**](spells.md#magic_user_spell_list) (elves have the same spell selection as magic-users).

**_Using Magic Items:_** As spell casters, elves are able to use magic scrolls of spells on their spell list. There are also items (e.g. magic wands) that may only be used by elves or magic-users.

#### <a name="elf_reaching_9th_level"></a>Reaching 9th Level

An elf can establish a stronghold in a natural setting, such as a forest or glen, upon reaching 9th level. Rather than impose upon nature, this keep must blend seamlessly with it. Even if the stronghold is not constructed of stone, the cost is the same due to the quality and artistry of elven craft. Because of the elven connection to nature, all ordinary animals within 5 miles of the stronghold will be kind and helpful to the elves. This helpfulness includes the ability to warn of dangers and pass information or even messages to others nearby. However, in exchange, an elven ruler must always defend the animals within his or her territory. Elven rulers can hire members of other races in the capacity of retainers or specialists, but only soldiers of elven stock may be hired.

Fighters are humans who dedicate themselves to mastering the arts of combat and war. In a group of adventurers, fighters are often particularly burdened because they are tougher and must take the lead to defend other characters.

#### <a name="fighter_abilities"></a>Abilities

**_Combat:_** Fighters can use all forms of weapon and armour.

**_Stronghold:_** Any time a fighter wishes (and has sufficient money), he or she can build a castle or stronghold and control the surrounding lands.

#### <a name="fighter_reaching_9th_level"></a>Reaching 9th Level

Upon achieving 9th level, a fighter may be granted a title such as Baron or Baroness. The land under the fighter's control is then known as a Barony.

### <a name="halfling"></a>Halfling

Requirements: Minimum CON and DEX 9
Prime Requisite: DEX and STR
Hit Dice: 1d6
Maximum Level: 8
Allowed Armour: Any appropriate to size, including shields
Allowed Weapons: Appropriate to size (see below)
Languages: Alignment language, Common, halfling

Halflings are small, rotund demi-humans with furry feet and curly hair. They weigh about 60 pounds and only attain a height of around 3 feet. They are as diverse in appearance as humans. Halflings are gentle-natured and value relaxation, good food, and good drink. They love comfort and will spend their riches on the most extravagant items.

**_Prime Requisites:_** A halfling must have at least 13 in one or the other prime requisite in order to get a +5% to experience. The character must have a STR and DEX of 13 or higher to get a +10% bonus.

#### <a name="halfling_abilities"></a>Abilities

**_Combat:_** Halflings may use any type of armour, though it must be tailored to their small size. Similarly, they may use any weapon which is appropriate to their stature. They cannot use longbows or two-handed swords.

**_Defensive Bonus:_** Because they are so small, halflings have a lower Armour Class (-2 bonus) when attacked by creatures greater than human sized.

**_Hiding:_** Halflings have an uncanny ability to disappear from sight:

- In bushes or other outdoor cover, a halfling can hide with 90% ability.
- In dungeons, a halfling can also hide in shadows or behind other forms of cover, so long as he or she remains silent and motionless. The chance of success is 2-in-6.

**_Initiative Bonus (optional rule):_** If using the optional rule for individual initiative (see [**_Basic Combat Procedure_**](core.md#basic_combat_procedure)), halflings get a bonus of +1 to initiative rolls.

**_Listening at Doors:_** Halflings have a 2-in-6 chance of hearing noises (see [**_Doors_**](core.md#doors)).

**_Missile Attack Bonus:_** Halflings' keen coordination grants them +1 on any missile attacks.

**_Stronghold:_** Any time a halfling wishes (and has sufficient money), he or she can build a stronghold. These strongholds will be in serene, beautiful valleys and halflings will come from great distances to settle there. The character becomes the leader of the people (called the sheriff) and must rule them wisely and well.

### <a name="magic_user"></a>Magic-User

Requirements: None  
Prime Requisite: INT  
Hit Dice: 1d4  
Maximum Level: 14  
Allowed Armour: None  
Allowed Weapons: Dagger only  
Languages: Alignment language, Common

Sometimes called wizards, warlocks, or witches, magic-users are humans who study arcane secrets and cast spells. Magic-users are able to cast a greater number of increasingly powerful spells as they advance in level.

#### <a name="magic_user_abilities"></a>Abilities

**_Combat:_** Magic-users may only use daggers and are unable to use shields or wear any kind of armour. For this reason, magic-users are weak at low levels and, in an adventuring group, should be protected.

**_Magical Research:_** A magic-user of any level may spend time and money to research new spells to add to his or her spell book. When a magic-user reaches 9th level, he or she is also able to create magic items and research other magical effects. These rules are detailed in the [**_Magic_**](core.md#magic) section.

**_Spell Casting:_** Magic-users carry spell books that hold the written formulae for arcane spells. A magic-user can only memorize a certain number of spells at any given time. The spell casting chart (below) shows both the number of spells in the magic-user's spell book and the number he or she may memorize, determined by the character's experience level. Thus, a 1st level magic-user has one spell in his or her spell book, selected by the referee (who may allow the player to choose). The rules for arcane spell casting and spell books are described in the [**_Magic_**](core.md#magic) section. The list of spells available to magic-users is provided in [**_Magic-User Spell List_**](spells.md#magic_user_spell_list).

**_Using Magic Items:_** As spell casters, magic-users are able to use magic scrolls of spells on their spell list. There are also items (e.g. magic wands) that may only be used by magic-users or elves.

#### <a name="reaching_11th_level"></a>Reaching 11th Level

A magic-user may build a stronghold, often a great tower, when he or she reaches level 11. 1d6 apprentices of levels 1-3 will then arrive to study under the magic-user.

### <a name="thief"></a>Thief

Requirements: None  
Prime Requisite: DEX  
Hit Dice: 1d4  
Maximum Level: 14  
Allowed Armour: Leather armour, no shields  
Allowed Weapons: Any  
Languages: Alignment language, Common

Thieves are humans who live by their wits and skills of deception and intrigue. Their range of unique skills makes them very handy companions in adventures. However, thieves are not always to be trusted.

**_Note:_** in step 3 of character creation ([**_adjust ability scores_**](#adjust_ability_scores)), thieves may not lower Strength.

#### <a name="thief_abilities"></a>Abilities

**_Back-stab:_** When attacking an unaware opponent from behind, a thief receives a +4 bonus to hit and doubles any damage dealt.

**_Combat:_** Because of their need of stealth and free movement, thieves cannot wear armour heavier than leather and cannot use shields. They can use any weapon.

**_Read Languages:_** A thief of 4th level or higher can read non-magical text in any language (including dead languages and basic codes) with 80% probability. If the roll does not succeed, the thief may not try to read that particular piece of writing again until he or she reaches a higher level of experience.

**_Scroll Use:_** A thief of 10th level or higher can cast spells from arcane scrolls with 90% accuracy. A failed roll means the spell does not function as expected and creates an unusual or deleterious effect.

**_Thief Skills:_** Thieves have the following skills, which improve as the character gains levels (see the chart below). Note that dice rolls for these abilities are usually made by the referee, because a thief is not always aware that he or she has failed!

- **_Climb Sheer Surfaces:_** Thieves are adept at scaling sheer surfaces, including walls or steep cliffs. A skill roll is required for each 100 feet to be climbed. If the roll fails, the thief falls a distance equal to half the attempted distance, taking 1d6 points of damage per 10 feet.

- **_Find or Remove Traps:_** A thief may only try one time to find or remove a trap in an area. Note that these are separate skills, for a thief must find a trap before he or she can remove it!

- **_Hear Noise:_** Thieves can attempt to listen for noises in a cave or hallway, at a door, or in other locations, but the thief must be quiet and in a quiet environment. Unlike the other thief abilities, this ability is rolled [by the referee] using 1d6.

- **_Hide in Shadows:_** A thief will always think he or she is successful in this skill and will not know otherwise until others react to his or her presence. A thief must remain motionless when hiding.

- **_Move Silently:_** When successful, others will not hear the movements of a thief. However, the thief always thinks he or she is moving silently and will only know otherwise by others' reaction.

- **_Pick Locks:_** A thief is skilled in picking locks, but needs thieves' tools to do so (see [**_Equipment_**](#equipment)). He or she can only try to pick a lock one time and, if the roll fails, may not try the same lock again before gaining an experience level.

- **_Pick Pockets:_** This skill is the bread and butter of non-adventuring thieves; it is a quick (if perilous) source of income. If the victim is above 5th level, the thief's roll is penalised by 5% for every level above 5th. There is always at least a 1% chance of failure. A roll of more than twice the percentage required for success means the intended target notices the thieving attempt. The referee will then roll 2d6 on the reaction table (see [**_Encounters_**](core.md#encounters)) to determine the target's reaction.

#### <a name="thief_reaching_9th_level"></a>Reaching 9th Level

When a thief attains level 9, he or she can establish a thief den. 2d6 thief apprentices of 1st level will come to work with the character. These thieves will serve the character with some reliability; however, should any be arrested or killed, the character will not be able to attract more followers of this type to replace them. A successful thief might use these followers to start a Thieves' Guild.

## <a name="alignment"></a>Alignment

All beings, whether player characters, NPCs, or monsters, adhere to one of three philosophies or spheres of behaviour, known as _alignments_. These spheres are Law, Neutrality, and Chaos. A player must choose one of these paths when his or her character is created.

**_Law:_** Lawful beings believe in truth and justice. To this end, they will follow laws and believe all things must adhere to order. Lawful beings also believe in sacrifice to a greater good and will choose the good of a larger group over the good of an individual.

**_Neutrality:_** Neutral beings believe in a balance between the ideas of Law and Chaos and, in their actions, they tend to do what will serve themselves. They might commit good or evil acts in order to further their own ends and generally will not put others' needs ahead of their own.

**_Chaos:_** Chaotic beings are in direct opposition to Law. These beings should seldom be trusted, for they tend to act in "evil" ways and will be much more selfish than a neutral being. Chaotic characters believe in chance and that there is no innate order to life.

### <a name="player_characters"></a>Player Characters

The player must inform the referee of his or her character's alignment, but does not have to tell other players. When determining the character's actions, players should do their best to adhere to their chosen alignment. The referee will take note when behaviour deviates too much and may assign a new alignment more appropriate to actual character actions. Deviation from alignment may also be penalised, as the referee sees fit.

## <a name="languages"></a>Languages

### <a name="the_common_tongue"></a>The Common Tongue

The common tongue (sometimes simply called _Common_) is a language which is widespread among intelligent species. All player character races---as well as many monsters (see below)---are able to speak Common.

It is assumed that the common tongue is a language common to all humans and used by other intelligent races. However, the referee may rule that different human cultures in the campaign world have different languages, in which case a particular human language must be chosen instead of Common.

### <a name="alignment_languages"></a>Alignment Languages

All intelligent beings know a secret, unwritten language of gestures, signs, and code words associated with their alignment. This secret language allows beings of the same alignment to communicate. Beings of another alignment will recognise when an alignment language is being used, but will not understand. It is not possible to learn another alignment language except by changing alignment, in which case the former language is forgotten.

### <a name="monster_languages"></a>Monster Languages

20% of intelligent monsters speak Common (unless the monster description states otherwise). Many intelligent monster species also have their own tongue.

### <a name="player_character_languages"></a>Player Character Languages

All PCs know the common tongue and their alignment language. Some classes grant further languages, as noted in the class descriptions, and characters with high Intelligence receive additional languages, chosen at the referee's discretion. The following list of languages may be used:

1. Bugbear
2. Doppelgänger
3. Dragon
4. Dwarvish
5. Elvish
6. Gargoyle
7. Gnoll
8. Gnome
9. Goblin
10. Halfling
11. Harpy
12. Hobgoblin
13. Kobold
14. Lizard man
15. Medusa
16. Minotaur
17. Ogre
18. Orc
19. Pixie
20. Human dialect

## <a name="character_advancement_and_death"></a>Character Advancement and Death

### <a name="parties_of_mixed_levels"></a>Parties of Mixed Levels

As new player characters join play (either due to the death of old characters or due to new players joining the group), the experience levels of the characters in the party may begin to diverge. It is recommended that characters more than four levels apart should adventure separately, as challenges which are suitable for higher level characters will be too dangerous for those of lower level. The opposite is also true: low-level adventures will not provide an interesting challenge to characters of higher level.

### <a name="level_titles"></a>Level Titles (Optional Rule)

In some campaigns, characters are not merely referred to by their numerical experience level (e.g. "2nd level magic-user"), but also gain the right to bear certain titles as they advance in level. Such titles may be granted by the guilds, colleges, or temples that PCs are associates of.

Level titles often vary greatly between campaign worlds, but the following lists may be used as inspiration:

**_Cleric:_** Acolyte, Adept, Priest(ess), Vicar, Curate, Elder, Bishop, Lama, Matriarch (Patriarch).

**_Dwarf:_** As fighter (e.g. Dwarven Veteran, Dwarven Warrior, etc).

**_Elf:_** As fighter and magic-user (e.g. Medium/Veteran, Seer/Warrior, etc).

**_Fighter:_** Veteran, Warrior, Swordmaster, Hero, Swashbuckler, Myrmidon, Champion, Superhero, Lord (Lady).

**_Halfling:_** As fighter (e.g. Halfling Veteran, Halfling Warrior, etc).

**_Magic-User:_** Medium, Seer, Conjurer, Magician, Enchanter (Enchantress), Witch (Warlock), Sorcerer (Sorceress), Necromancer, Wizard.

**_Thief:_** Apprentice, Footpad, Robber, Burglar, Cutpurse, Sharper, Pilferer, Thief, Master Thief.

### <a name="high_level_play"></a>High Level Play (Optional Rule)

Human character classes are listed as having a maximum level of 14. This range of levels presents the best play experience, in terms of challenge and reward. Some groups, however, may wish to continue play into the extremely high levels beyond. In this case, human characters may continue advancing to a maximum of 36th level. This must be carefully considered, as PCs of some classes will be left behind, due to their strict level limits. If the referee allows continued play into higher levels, the following guidelines may be used. Additionally, other rule books are available which detail high level play.

Note that however far a character's ability to hit in combat advances, the minimum modified roll required to hit is never less than 2.

**_Clerics_** require an additional 100,000 XP per level beyond 14th and gain 1 hit point per level gained. Their chance to hit in combat improves by 2 every 4 levels. Spells of higher levels become available as the character advances.

**_Fighters_** require an additional 120,000 XP per level beyond 14th and gain 2 hit points per level gained. Their chance to hit in combat improves by 2 every 3 levels. Fighters of 20th level may make two attacks per round. This increases to three attacks per round at 25th level and four per round at 30th level.

**_Magic-users_** require an additional 150,000 XP per level beyond 14th and gain 1 hit point per level gained. Their chance to hit in combat improves by 2 every 5 levels. Spells of higher levels become available as the character advances.

**_Thieves_** require an additional 120,000 XP per level beyond 14th and gain 2 hit points per level gained. Their chance to hit in combat improves by 2 every 4 levels. Additional skills become available to high level thieves, including the ability to climb upside down or horizontally, voice skills such as mimicry and ventriloquism, and other skills of deception.

## <a name="money_and_wealth"></a>Money and Wealth

### <a name="coinage"></a>Coinage

The most common coin is the gold piece (gp). Coins made of other types of precious metals---platinum, electrum, silver, and copper---are also used. Platinum is more valuable than gold: a platinum piece (pp) is worth 5 gold pieces. Coins of the other metals are less valuable than gold: a gold piece is worth 2 electrum pieces (ep), 10 silver pieces (sp), or 100 copper pieces (cp).

Player characters begin play with 3d6 &times; 10 gold pieces.

### <a name="inheritance"></a>Inheritance

Faced with the possibility of character death, players may take efforts to ensure the amassed wealth of their PCs is not simply lost if the PC dies. The referee may allow players to create a will for their characters, to leave treasure behind for an heir.

- Any treasure left as an inheritance will be taxed at 10%. (A player might try to leave money to an heir through clandestine means, such as burying it and leaving a map behind, but this is more risky.)
- A character's heir must be a new, 1st level character.
- A player is only allowed to leave a character inheritance one time.

## <a name="water_transportation"></a>Water Transportation

The vessels described in this section span various historical periods from ancient galleys to medieval sailing ships. Vessels are propelled by rowing or sailing, with some able to use either means. The necessary crew and the resulting speeds are given on the following pages. The pay rates for crew are given in [**_Specialists_**](#specialists).

### <a name="seaworthiness"></a>Seaworthiness

Water vessels are divided into two broad categories: those which are suitable for use on the high seas and those which are restricted to rivers, lakes, or coastal waters.

#### <a name="dimensions"></a>Dimensions

A ship's _beam_ is its width and its _draft_ is the depth it extends beneath the water.

#### <a name="seaworthy_vessels"></a>Seaworthy Vessels

Vessel | Cost (gp) | Maximum Cargo (Coins) | Usage | Length | Beam | Draft
---------|-------|--------|-----|-----|-------|------

&dagger; _Not defined in the traditional Expert rules; value extrapolated from similar vessels._

#### <a name="high_winds"></a>High Winds

Unseaworthy vessels are designed for use in rivers, lakes, or coastal waters, not on the open seas. They are thus not built to withstand high winds (see [**_Water Travel_**](core.md#water_travel)). These vessels suffer as follows in extreme winds:

**_Near gale:_** With the optional variable wind conditions rule, a result of 11 indicates near gale conditions. Unseaworthy vessels have a 20% chance (increased from the usual 10% chance) of taking on water.

**_Gale:_** During gale conditions, unseaworthy vessels are affected as follows:

- There is an 80% chance of the vessel being overrun with water and sinking.
- Unseaworthy vessels with sails cannot move with the wind to avoid damage.
- If the vessel is in sight of land when the gale hits, it may attempt to beach. If the shore is relatively clear of physical dangers (rocks, cliffs, etc), this is automatically successful; otherwise there is a 2-in-6 chance of finding a safe harbour to weather the storm.

### <a name="vessel_descriptions"></a>Vessel Descriptions

**_Boat, river:_** Riverboats are either rowed or pushed with poles. The cost of the boat increases by 1,000 gp if it has a roof (to protect passengers or cargo).

**_Boat, sailing:_** A small boat typically used for fishing in lakes or coastal waters.

**_Canoe:_** A small boat made of hide or canvas stretched over a wooden frame. Because of its small size and lightweight construction, a canoe may be carried by two people (weighing 500 coins).

**_Galley, large:_** A long ship with a shallow draft and a single, square-sailed mast.

**_Galley, small:_** A ship with a shallow draft and a single, square-sailed mast.

**_Galley, war:_** A large, specially constructed galley that is generally a fleet's flagship. War galleys are always fitted with a ram (comes with the basic cost) and have a full deck above the rowers. They have two masts and 10'-20' wide wooden towers rising 15'-20' above the bow and stern.

**_Lifeboat:_** A small boat with a mast that folds down for storage. A small ship usually has 1-2 lifeboats, while larger ships may have 3-4. A lifeboat weighs 5,000 coins and reduces the cargo capacity of the ship on which it is carried by this much. A lifeboat is usually equipped with rations to feed ten human-sized beings for one week.

**_Longship:_** A narrow ship which may be used in rivers, coastal waters, or the open seas. A longship may be rowed or sailed, depending on the conditions. The crew typically fill the role of oarsmen, sailors, and fighters, as needed.

**_Sailing ship, large:_** A large, seaworthy vessel with up to three masts. Usually has multiple decks and raised "castles" at the bow and stern.

**_Sailing ship, small:_** A small, seaworthy vessel with a single mast.

**_Troop transport (large, small):_** These ships have similar dimensions and characteristics to normal sailing ships, but are specially designed to carry troops, mounts, and equipment of war as their cargo.

**_Warship (large, small):_** These ships have similar dimensions and characteristics to normal sailing ships, but are specially designed to carry mercenaries and war gear.

**_Raft, makeshift:_** Given sufficient wood, characters may build a makeshift raft in 1-3 days per 10' square section (up to a maximum size of 20' &times; 30').

**_Raft, professional:_** A professionally built raft has raised sides, a basic steering oar, and some form of shelter for goods or passengers. Such a raft may be up to 30' &times; 40'. Professionally built rafts are sometimes floated downstream with cargo and then broken down and sold for the value of their wood (25cp per square foot).

**_Movement Rate:_** Distance moved in one exploration turn; per-round encounter movement rate in parentheses.

\* Crew may take on the roles of oarsmen, sailors, and fighters.

&dagger; Specialist crew not required. Unskilled characters (e.g. PCs) may pilot the vessel.

### <a name="rowed_movement"></a>Rowed Movement

For rowed vessels, the encounter movement rate represents a great effort on the part of the oarsmen. Such speeds cannot be maintained for long periods, thus the movement rates per turn and per day are much slower.

#### <a name="reduced_crew"></a>Reduced Crew

Having less than the required number of oarsmen reduces a vessel's speed. For every 10% reduction in the available rowing crew, the vessel's rowing speed is reduced by an equal percentage. For example, if 10% of the oarsmen are being used to repair hull damage, the vessel moves at 90% of its normal speed (i.e. 10% slower than normal).

### <a name="vessel_combat_stats"></a>Vessel Combat Stats

Warship (small) | 25 | 8 | 60-90 | - | Up to 1

#### <a name="marines"></a>Mercenaries

Some vessels have space aboard for mercenaries in addition to the normal crew of sailors/oarsmen. These mercenaries are optional and may be of any type. (See [**_Mercenaries_**](#mercenaries).)

#### <a name="hull_points"></a>Hull Points

In combat, attacks and damage may be directed at water vessels in addition to characters and monsters. A water vessel has a number of hull points. These are analogous to a creature's hit points. Normal attacks (bows, swords, etc.) do not inflict hull damage, but spells, magical attacks, and the attacks of giant sea monsters inflict one point of hull damage per five points of normal hit point damage the attack does.

#### <a name="effects_of_hull_damage"></a>Effects of Hull Damage

When a vessel loses hull points, its movement rate is also affected. This may be due to taking on water or because of structural damage influencing how the vessel passes through water. For every 10% a ship is reduced from its maximum hull points, its movement is reduced by an equal percentage. For example, if a ship loses 20% of its hull points, its movement is reduced by 20%.

When a vessel is reduced to 0 hull points, it will sink in 1d10 rounds. Any mounted weaponry is no longer functional.

#### <a name="repairs"></a>Repairs

It takes five crew-members one turn to repair one hull point. This task requires full attention, so any crew involved in repair cannot take any other action during a turn repairing a vessel. Only half of all damage sustained to a ship can be repaired at sea by the crew, the remaining damage can only be repaired by facilities at a dock.

### <a name="ship_modifications"></a>Ship Modifications

The following modifications may be made to an existing ship:

- A sailing ship may be converted into a warship or troop transport of the same size. The modification costs one-third of the ship's original cost.
- A catapult may be added to a galley, longship, or warship.
- A ram may be added to a large or small galley (a war galley already comes with a ram fitted).

### <a name="ship_weaponry"></a>Ship Weaponry

Item | Cost (gp)
---------|-----
Catapult | 100
Catapult shot | 5
Catapult shot, pitch | 25
Ram, large galley | 10,000
Ram, small galley | 3,000

### <a name="weaponry_descriptions"></a>Weaponry Descriptions

**_Catapult:_** Fires either large rocks or flaming pitch and may be operated by 2-4 crew. A catapult, along with twenty rounds of shot, weighs 10,000 coins. This must be subtracted from the ship's cargo allowance.

The range of attacks is 150-300 yards. Attack rolls may be modified for weather conditions, manoeuvrability, etc. Attacks are made as a fighter of level equal to the number of crew manning the catapult (minimum 2, maximum 4). The rate of fire also depends on the number of crew: every 5 rounds with four crew, every 8 rounds with three crew, or every 10 rounds with two crew.

**_Catapult shot:_** Inflicts 3d6 hull points of damage against ships.

**_Catapult shot, pitch:_** Sets a 10'&times;10' area of a ship on fire. The burning does 1d6 hull points of damage per turn (for at least one turn) and will spread to other areas of the ship, if not extinguished. A fire may be put out by five crew in 3 turns, ten crew in 2 turns, or fifteen crew in 1 turn.

**_Ram:_** War galleys have a ram built in. A ram may be added to a large or small galley. Attacks with a ram are made using the attack chart for 1st level fighters and occur at the same point in the combat sequence as missile fire. Attack rolls may be modified for weather conditions, manoeuvrability, etc. A ram can only be used against large targets (e.g. other ships or giant sea monsters); small individuals cannot be targeted.

- Large or war galley: Deals 1d6+5 &times; 10 hull points damage against ships and 6d6 hit points damage against monsters.
- Small galley: Deals 1d4+4 &times; 10 hull points damage against ships and 3d8 hit points damage against monsters.

## <a name="mercenaries"></a>Mercenaries

Mercenaries are typically hired as soldiers and will guard, patrol, and otherwise serve in wilderness settings, but only as part of a larger force, not an adventuring group.

Note that as mercenaries are hired by a character to perform specific services, they are not treated as retainers and thus do not count toward a character's maximum number of retainers.

### <a name="mercenary_locating_and_hiring"></a>Locating and Hiring

Mercenaries may be located by frequenting pubs or by posting notices of help wanted. There may also be guilds that can act as a contact point for recruiting mercenaries.

The most commonly found types of mercenary are listed in the following table, along with their monthly rates of pay.

### <a name="mercenary_wages_and_upkeep"></a>Wages and Upkeep

The monthly rate of pay includes food and basic gear. Most mercenaries already have weapons and armour when hired, though their employer may equip them with additional gear. Note that armourers (see [**_Specialists_**](#specialists)) are required to repair mercenaries' armour and weapons.

### <a name="common_mercenary_types"></a>Common Mercenary Types

Type | Weapons | AC | Base Morale | Human | Dwarf | Elf | Orc | Goblin

**_Wage per Month:_** This is the rate of pay out of wartime. In wartime, all wages are doubled.

**_AC:_** 9 = no armour; 7 = leather; 6 = leather + shield; 5 = chainmail; 4 = chainmail + shield; 3 = plate mail.

### <a name="morale"></a>Morale

Like retainers, mercenaries have a morale rating. However, the morale rating of a group of mercenaries is determined solely by their type---it does not depend on the CHA of the hiring character.
The table of common mercenary types to the left lists their basic morale rating, but the following chart may be used to calculate the morale of other types of mercenary:

**Mercenary Type** | **Morale**
------------------|---
Peasants, Militia | 6
Barbarians | 7
Soldiers, Men-at-arms | 8
Mounted soldiers | +1
Elite soldiers | +1
Fanatic soldiers, Berserkers | +2

#### <a name="modifiers"></a>Modifiers

At the referee's discretion, the morale score of a group of mercenaries may be modified based on working conditions. If the mercenaries are being killed frequently or subjected to other abuses, morale will be low. If the mercenaries are enjoying riches and excitement, it might be higher.

## <a name="specialists"></a>Specialists

All types of character that PCs may wish to hire for non-combat and non-adventuring purposes (i.e. not mercenaries or retainers) are termed specialists.

Note that as specialists are hired by a character to perform specific services, they are not treated as retainers and thus do not count toward a character's maximum number of retainers.

### <a name="specialist_locating_and_hiring"></a>Locating and Hiring

Specialists may be located by frequenting pubs or by posting notices of help wanted. There may also be guilds which can act as a contact point for recruiting specialists.

### <a name="pecialist_wages_and_upkeep"></a>Wages and Upkeep

Several possible types of specialist are described below, along with their typical monthly pay rates. The monthly rate of pay includes food and basic gear. This list is not exhaustive and the referee may create additional types of specialist as needed.

Specialist | Wage per Month
----------|--------
Alchemist | 1,000gp
Animal trainer | 500gp
Armourer | 100gp
Assistant armourer | 15gp&dagger;
Blacksmith | 25gp
Engineer | 750gp
Navigator | 150gp
Oarsman | 2gp
Sage | 2,000gp
Sailor | 10gp
Ship's captain | 250gp
Spy | 500gp (or more)

&dagger; _Not defined in the traditional Expert rules; value extrapolated from similar specialists._

### <a name="descriptions"></a>Descriptions

#### <a name="alchemist"></a>Alchemist

Alchemists dedicate their expertise to creating potions and other concoctions. Based on a sample or recipe, an alchemist can produce a potion at twice the normal speed and for half the normal cost (see [**_Magical Research_**](core.md#magical_research)). An alchemist may also research new potions, but this takes twice as long and costs twice as much as normal.

#### <a name="animal_trainer"></a>Animal Trainer

All animal trainers are specialized in a particular kind of animal and can have up to six animals under their care at a time. Trainers are not required for small numbers of common animals like dogs, horses, or mules, but more exotic animals or larger numbers of normal animals require a specialized trainer.

The referee decides how long an animal must be trained, based on the nature of the training. It will take a minimum of one month to teach an animal the first new behaviour or trick. After this first month, an animal has become accustomed to the trainer and can be taught additional behaviours at twice the rate (two weeks per behaviour). If training is interrupted, all time already spent on that particular behaviour is lost and the animal becomes unable to learn further behaviours.

#### <a name="armourer"></a>Armourer

An armourer may either:

- Produce weapons and armour: Per month, an armourer can make five weapons, three shields, or one complete suit of armour.
- Maintain mercenaries' gear: One armourer is required per 50 troops.

The output of an armourer (either in terms of arms produced or troops maintained) may be doubled by hiring two assistant armourers and one blacksmith. If four assistants and two blacksmiths are hired, the armourer's output may be quadrupled. An armourer cannot coordinate more assistants than this.

#### <a name="assistant_armourer"></a>Assistant Armourer

Apprentices who may work under an armourer to increase the rate of production. See _Armourer_.

#### <a name="blacksmith"></a>Blacksmith

Craftsmen trained in the art of forging metal. Blacksmiths may be hired to work under an armourer to increase the rate of production. See _Armourer_.

#### <a name="engineer"></a>Engineer

Engineers plan and oversee large construction projects, such as building [**_Castles or Strongholds_**](#castles_or_strongholds). The number of engineers required for a construction project depends on the overall cost of the building: one engineer is needed per 100,000 gp value of the project. Human engineers usually handle large aboveground structures, while dwarves may be hired for underground construction.

#### <a name="navigator"></a>Navigator

A navigator is a sailor who understands how to read charts and navigate based on instruments and the position of the stars. Any time a ship ventures beyond sight of a coastline, it becomes lost if a navigator is not aboard. (See [**_Losing Direction_**](core.md#losing_direction).)

#### <a name="oarsman"></a>Oarsman

Unskilled normal humans who man the oars of sea vessels. They are not trained for combat.

#### <a name="sage"></a>Sage

Sages are rare individuals who devote their lives to the study of an obscure and specific subject area (e.g. dragons, ancient history). A sage may be consulted for information in his or her specialist area. Characters may have to pay the monthly rate in addition to any other supplies the sage needs to research their question, as determined by the referee. If the information is particularly difficult to obtain, it will cost the characters extra. In addition, despite the special knowledge sages have, they are occasionally wrong when it comes to particularly obscure questions. The referee will decide what questions are obscure and the probability of achieving a wrong answer. If the characters receive a wrong answer, they may not realize it!

#### <a name="sailor"></a>Sailor

Skilled normal humans who can handle a ship. Sailors can fight to defend their ship, typically being equipped with a sword, shield, and leather armour.

#### <a name="ships_captain"></a>Ship's Captain

A captain is required for any large ship, is skilled like a sailor, and has an intimate knowledge of the particular coasts he or she frequents.

#### <a name="spy"></a>Spy

A spy is hired to gather information about a specific person or group. The spy may be an outsider who tries to infiltrate or may be a traitor already connected with the person or group to be spied upon. Spies are often NPC thieves, but may be of any character class. The referee will determine the time required for the job and the probability of success in the mission, based on the circumstances. Spies may or may not be reliable and could stab the hiring character in the back (perhaps literally!).

## <a name="castles_and_strongholds"></a>Castles and Strongholds

### <a name="planning_and_construction"></a>Planning and Construction

The construction of a castle or stronghold has the following steps:

1. **_Permission:_** It is sometimes necessary to secure permission to build from an existing authority over the land. This may not be required if the land is wilderness and is uncharted.

2. **_Clear land:_** All monsters in the local area (one hex on a small-scale wilderness map---typically 6 miles across) must be killed or driven off.

3. **_Design:_** The player must create a plan for the stronghold and calculate the costs based on the price suggestions listed in this section. The plan should take account of the required thickness of the walls (see the dimensions of different structures, opposite).

4. **_Review:_** The referee should review and approve the player's plans.

5. **_Hire engineers:_** In addition to normal building costs, the character must hire at least one engineer per 100,000 gp cost of the stronghold.

6. **_Construction:_** Once the land has been cleared and construction materials delivered, construction may commence. The time required depends entirely on the stronghold's total price: one day of game time per 500 gp.

7. **_Prepare for settlers:_** When construction is complete, the character may wish to clear any monsters out of adjacent hexes, so as to provide a safe area for settlers.

### <a name="building_in_towns"></a>Building in Towns

If a character has permission to build in an existing town or city, the costs are greatly reduced due to the proximity of materials and labour. Stone buildings cost 40% of the listed price and wooden buildings 20%. It is unlikely that the local ruler will grant permission for the construction of castles or fortifications by player characters in a town.

### <a name="maintaining_cleared_lands"></a>Maintaining Cleared Lands

In order to prevent monsters from returning to cleared lands, mercenaries may be hired to conduct patrols. These patrols can cover a maximum of an 18-mile radius around a stronghold (6 miles, in inhospitable terrain such as swamp, mountains, or thick jungle). If the area to be maintained is larger than this radius, additional garrisons must be stationed at intervals.

### <a name="settlers_and_taxation"></a>Settlers and Taxation

The character may wish to attract settlers into a cleared area. In addition to ensuring the safety of surrounding lands, the character will have to fund construction of other buildings (e.g. mills, inns, docks, etc.) to attract settlers. Advertising may also be necessary. The referee will determine the costs involved and how many settlers are attracted.

The character can expect to gain money through taxes at a rate of 10 gp per settler per year. These taxes can be used to pay patrolling mercenaries or to further invest in infrastructure that encourages commerce.

### <a name="standard_structures"></a>Standard Structures

Structure | Description | Dimensions | Cost
----------|-------------|------------|-----
Barbican | Heavily fortified entry/exit point in a castle wall. Consists of two small towers, a gatehouse, and a drawbridge. | See small tower, gatehouse, drawbridge | 37,000gp

#### <a name="non_standard_dimensions"></a>Non-Standard Dimensions

**_Bastion:_** Bastions of different dimensions to those listed above may be constructed. Use the guidelines for tower pricing, below, and divide by two.

**_Tower:_** Towers of different dimensions to those listed above may be constructed. The cost is determined as follows:

- The diameter of a tower's base determines the cost per 10' of height and the maximum height (twice the base diameter).
- Up to the base diameter, each 10' of height costs 200 gp &times; the base diameter in feet.
- Above the base diameter, each 10' of height costs 400 gp &times; the base diameter in feet.

>**Example Tower Cost Calculation**
>
>A 60' high tower with a 40' diameter base is to be constructed.
>
>The cost will be 8,000 gp (40 &times; 200 gp) per 10' for the first 40' of height and 16,000 gp (40 &times; 400 gp) per 10' for the remainder of the height.
>
>The total cost is thus (8,000 gp &times; 4) + (16,000 gp &times; 2) = 64,000 gp.

**_Wall, castle:_** Higher castle walls may be constructed at increased cost. A 100' length of 30' high wall costs 7,500 gp. Every additional 10' of height beyond this (up to a maximum of 60' high) costs 5,000 gp.

### <a name="interior_details"></a>Interior Details

For simplicity, the cost of a stronghold may be increased by 25% to account for interior details, including: reinforced doors, stone stairs, flagstone flooring, tile roofing, windows or arrow slits, bars and shutters on windows, and standard furnishings.
