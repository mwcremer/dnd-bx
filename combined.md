## [Ability Scores](name:ability_scores)

### [Roll Ability Scores](name:roll_ability_scores)

Character ability scores are determined by rolling randomly. Roll 3d6 for your character's Strength, Intelligence, Wisdom, Dexterity, Constitution, and Charisma.

### [Ability Score Modifiers](name:ability_score_modifiers)

Below are the standard ability score modifiers.

Ability | Standard Modifier
--------|--------------------
3 | &minus;3
4--5 | &minus;2
6--8 | &minus;1
9--12 | None
13--15 | +1
16--17 | +2
18 | +3

### [Strength](name:str)

Strength (STR) rates a character's brawn, muscle, and physical power. This ability is especially important for characters who focus on melee combat.

- The [***Standard Modifier***](#ability_score_modifiers) is applied to attack and damage rolls with melee weapons and to attempts to force open a stuck [door](#doors).

### [Intelligence](name:int)

Intelligence (INT) determines how well a character learns, remembers, and reasons.

- ***Language Ability*** denotes the character's ability to speak, read, and write in his or her native tongue and other languages.
- ***Bonus Languages*** determines the number of additional languages the character can choose during character creation.

INT | Language Ability | Bonus Languages
--|--|--
3 | Unable to read or write, broken speech | 0
4--5 | Unable to read or write | 0
6--8 | Can write simple words | 0
9--12 | Can read and write native languages | 0
13--15 | Can read and write native languages | 1
16--17 | Can read and write native languages | 2
18 | Can read and write native languages | 3

### [Wisdom](name:wis)

Wisdom (WIS) encompasses a character's willpower, common sense, perception, and intuition. While Intelligence represents one's ability to analyse information, Wisdom represents being in tune with and aware of one's surroundings.

- The [***Standard Modifier***](#ability_score_modifiers) is applied to saving throws versus magical effects. This normally does not include saves against breath attacks, but may apply to any other saving throw category.

### [Dexterity](name:dex)

Dexterity (DEX) measures hand-eye coordination, agility, reflexes, and balance. This ability is important for combat-oriented classes, as it affects Armour Class, and for characters who focus on missile combat.

- The [***Standard Modifier***](#ability_score_modifiers) is applied to attack rolls (but not damage rolls) made with a ranged weapon and modifies the character's Armour Class (a bonus lowers AC, a penalty raises it).
- ***Initiative Adjustment*** modifies the character's initiative roll, if the optional rule for individual initiative is being used (see [***Basic Combat Procedure***](#basic_combat_procedure)).

DEX | Initiative Adjustment
--|---
3 | &minus;2
4--5 | &minus;1
6--8 | &minus;1
9--12 | None
13--15 | +1
16--17 | +1
18 | +2

### [Constitution](name:con)

Constitution (CON) represents a character's health and stamina. A Constitution bonus increases a character's hit points, making this ability important for all classes.

- The [***Standard Modifier***](#ability_score_modifiers) applies when rolling a character's hit points (i.e. at 1st level and every time a level is gained thereafter). A character always gains at least 1 hit point per Hit Die, regardless of CON modifier.

### [Charisma](name:cha)

Charisma (CHA) measures a character's force of personality, persuasiveness, personal magnetism, physical attractiveness, and ability to lead. This ability is important for how NPCs or monsters will respond to a character in an encounter. Charisma also determines the number of retainers a character may have and their morale.

- ***Reaction Adjustment*** applies when hiring Retainers and when interacting with monsters (see [***Encounters***](#encounters)).
- ***Max # of Retainers*** and ***Retainer Morale*** determine the number of [***Retainers***](#retainers) a character may have in his or her pay at any one time and their loyalty to the character.

CHA | Reaction Adjustment | Max # of Retainers | Retainer Morale
--|----|---|---
3 | &minus;2 | 1 | 4
4--5 | &minus;1 | 2 | 5
6--8 | &minus;1 | 3 | 6
9--12 | None | 4 | 7
13--15 | +1 | 5 | 8
16--17 | +1 | 6 | 9
18 | +2 | 7 | 10

### [Sub-Par Characters](name:sub_par_characters)

If you roll a character with very poor ability scores---for example an 8 or less in every score or an extremely low rating in one ability---the referee may sometimes allow you to discard the character and start again.

### [Prime Requisite](name:prime_requisite)

Each character class has one or more prime requisites, that is, an ability score or scores that are of especial importance to characters of that class. A character's score in his or her class' prime requisite(s) affects how quickly the character is able to gain experience points.

- ***XP Adjustment*** is applied to all experience points awarded to the character, unless otherwise noted in the description of the class.

Score | XP Adjustment
--|--
3--5 | &minus;20%
6--8 | &minus;10%
9--12 | None
13--15 | +5%
16--18 | +10%

### [Adjust Ability Scores](name:adjust_ability_scores)

Optionally, the prime requisite(s) of your character (determined by the chosen class) may be raised by lowering other (non-prime requisite) ability scores. For every two points by which an ability score is reduced, one point may be added to your prime requisite. The following restrictions apply:

- Only Intelligence, Strength, and Wisdom may be lowered in this way.
- No score may be lowered below 9.
- Some classes may have extra constraints.

## [Character Classes](name:character_classes)

Select one of the classes available, bearing in mind the minimum ability score requirements of some classes.

### [Fighter](name:fighter)

**Requirements**: None  
**Prime Requisite**: STR  
**Hit Dice**: 1d8  
**Maximum Level**: 14  
**Allowed Armour**: Any, including shields  
**Allowed Weapons**: Any  
**Languages**: Alignment language, Common

Fighters are humans who dedicate themselves to mastering the arts of combat and war. In a group of adventurers, fighters are often particularly burdened because they are tougher and must take the lead to defend other characters.

#### [Abilities](name:fighter_abilities)

***Combat:*** Fighters can use all forms of weapon and armour.

***Stronghold:*** Any time a fighter wishes (and has sufficient money), he or she can build a castle or stronghold and control the surrounding lands.

#### [Reaching 9th Level](name:fighter_reaching_9th_level)

Upon achieving 9th level, a fighter may be granted a title such as Baron or Baroness. The land under the fighter's control is then known as a Barony.

#### [Fighter Level Progression](name:fighter_level_progression)

### [Cleric](name:cleric)

**Requirements**: None  
**Prime Requisite**: WIS  
**Hit Dice**: 1d6  
**Maximum Level**: 14  
**Allowed Armour**: Any, including shields  
**Allowed Weapons**: Any blunt weapons  
**Languages**: Alignment language, Common

Clerics are humans who have sworn to serve a deity. They conduct their lives in a way to further the will of their deity and channel the power of their deity. Clerics are trained for combat; they should be thought of as fighting holy crusaders, not as passive priests.

***Holy Symbol:*** A cleric must carry a holy symbol (see [***Equipment***](#equipment)).

***Deity Disfavour:*** If a cleric ever falls from favour, due to violating the beliefs or strictures of his or her deity or clergy, penalties (determined by the referee) may be imposed upon the cleric. These may include penalties to attack (&minus;1) or even a reduction in spells.

#### [Abilities](name:cleric_abilities)

***Combat:*** Clerics can use any form of armour, but strict holy doctrine prevents their use of weapons that have a sharp edge. Thus, only the following weapons from the standard lists in [***Weapons***](#weapons) may be used: club, mace, sling, staff, warhammer.

***Magical Research:*** A cleric of any level may spend time and money to research new spells associated with his or her deity. When a cleric reaches 9th level, he or she is also able to create magic items and research other magical effects. These rules are detailed in [Magical Research](#magical_research).

***Spell Casting:*** From 2nd level, a cleric may pray to receive spells from his or her deity. The power and number of spells available to a cleric are determined by the character's experience level. The rules for divine spell casting are found in [Casting a Spell](#casting_a_spell).

***Turning the Undead:*** Clerics are able to call upon the name and power of their deity to repel or even destroy undead. This ability is known as _turning the undead_. The chart below lists a dash, a "T", a "D", or a number corresponding to the Hit Dice of an undead creature and the level of the cleric:

- A dash means an automatic failure.
- A number indicates that the player must roll that number or higher on 2d6 in order to successfully turn the undead.
- A "T" means that the turning automatically succeeds for this type of undead.
- A "D" means that the turning automatically succeeds for this type of undead and that the monsters are destroyed, not simply caused to flee.

If the turning attempt succeeds, the player rolls 2d6 to determine the number of Hit Dice of undead affected (either turned or destroyed). No matter what the dice roll result, at least one undead creature will always be turned or destroyed, as appropriate, on a successful turning. Turned undead will leave the area, if possible, and will not harm or make contact with the cleric.

If _turn undead_ is used against a mixed group of undead monsters of different types, those with the lowest HD are affected first.

***Using Magic Items:*** As spell casters, clerics can use magic scrolls of spells on their spell list. There are also items (e.g. some staves) that only clerics can use.

#### [Reaching 9th Level](name:cleric_reaching_9th_level)

Once attaining 9th level, a cleric may establish or build a stronghold. So long as the cleric is currently in favour with his or her god, a stronghold may be bought or built at half the normal price, due to divine intervention.

Once a stronghold is established, the cleric will attract followers (5d6 &times; 10 fighters of 1st or 2nd level). These troops are completely devoted to the cleric (never checking morale). The referee chooses which proportions of followers are 1st and 2nd level and which are bowmen, infantry, etc.

#### [Cleric Level Progression](name:cleric_level_progression)

Level | XP | Hit Dice | AC0 | Death | Wands | Paralysis | Breath | Spells
--|---|-----|----|----|----|----|----|---
1 | 0 | 1d6 | 19 | 11 | 12 | 14 | 16 | 15

\* _2 Hit Dice monsters with a special ability (e.g. paralysing touch, immunity to normal weapons, etc.) are more difficult to turn, as indicated by this column of the chart. Such monsters will have an asterisk next to their HD rating, in the monster description._

### [Magic-User](name:magic_user)

**Requirements**: None  
**Prime Requisite**: INT  
**Hit Dice**: 1d4  
**Maximum Level**: 14  
**Allowed Armour**: None  
**Allowed Weapons**: Dagger only  
**Languages**: Alignment language, Common

Sometimes called wizards, warlocks, or witches, magic-users are humans who study arcane secrets and cast spells. Magic-users are able to cast a greater number of increasingly powerful spells as they advance in level.

#### [Abilities](name:magic_user_abilities)

***Combat:*** Magic-users may only use daggers and are unable to use shields or wear any kind of armour. For this reason, magic-users are weak at low levels and, in an adventuring group, should be protected.

***Magical Research:*** A magic-user of any level may spend time and money to research new spells to add to his or her spell book. When a magic-user reaches 9th level, he or she is also able to create magic items and research other magical effects. These rules are detailed in the [***Magical Research***](#magical_research) section.

***Spell Casting:*** Magic-users carry spell books that hold the written formulae for arcane spells. A magic-user can only memorize a certain number of spells at any given time. The spell casting chart (below) shows both the number of spells in the magic-user's spell book and the number he or she may memorize, determined by the character's experience level. Thus, a 1st level magic-user has one spell in his or her spell book, selected by the referee (who may allow the player to choose). The rules for arcane spell casting and spell books are described in the [***Magic***](#magic) section.

***Using Magic Items:*** As spell casters, magic-users are able to use magic scrolls of spells on their spell list. There are also items (e.g. magic wands) that may only be used by magic-users or elves.

#### [Reaching 11th Level](name:reaching_11th_level)

A magic-user may build a stronghold, often a great tower, when he or she reaches level 11. 1d6 apprentices of levels 1--3 will then arrive to study under the magic-user.

#### [Magic-User Level Progression](name:magic_user_level_progression)

**Prime Requisite**: DEX  
**Hit Dice**: 1d4

**Allowed Weapons**: Any

Thieves are humans who live by their wits and skills of deception and intrigue. Their range of unique skills makes them very handy companions in adventures. However, thieves are not always to be trusted.

***Note:*** in step 3 of character creation ([***adjust ability scores***](#adjust_ability_scores)), thieves may not lower Strength.

#### [Abilities](name:thief_abilities)

***Back-stab:*** When attacking an unaware opponent from behind, a thief receives a +4 bonus to hit and doubles any damage dealt.

***Combat:*** Because of their need of stealth and free movement, thieves cannot wear armour heavier than leather and cannot use shields. They can use any weapon.

***Read Languages:*** A thief of 4th level or higher can read non-magical text in any language (including dead languages and basic codes) with 80% probability. If the roll does not succeed, the thief may not try to read that particular piece of writing again until he or she reaches a higher level of experience.

***Scroll Use:*** A thief of 10th level or higher can cast spells from arcane scrolls with 90% accuracy. A failed roll means the spell does not function as expected and creates an unusual or deleterious effect.

***Thief Skills:*** Thieves have the following skills, which improve as the character gains levels (see the chart below). Note that dice rolls for these abilities are usually made by the referee, because a thief is not always aware that he or she has failed!

- ***Climb Sheer Surfaces:*** Thieves are adept at scaling sheer surfaces, including walls or steep cliffs. A skill roll is required for each 100 feet to be climbed. If the roll fails, the thief falls a distance equal to half the attempted distance, taking 1d6 points of damage per 10 feet.
- ***Find or Remove Traps:*** A thief may only try one time to find or remove a trap in an area. Note that these are separate skills, for a thief must find a trap before he or she can remove it!
- ***Hear Noise:*** Thieves can attempt to listen for noises in a cave or hallway, at a door, or in other locations, but the thief must be quiet and in a quiet environment. Unlike the other thief abilities, this ability is rolled using 1d6.
- ***Hide in Shadows:*** A thief will always think he or she is successful in this skill and will not know otherwise until others react to his or her presence. A thief must remain motionless when hiding.
- ***Move Silently:*** When successful, others will not hear the movements of a thief. However, the thief always thinks he or she is moving silently and will only know otherwise by others' reaction.
- ***Pick Locks:*** A thief is skilled in picking locks, but needs thieves' tools to do so (see [***Equipment***](#equipment)). He or she can only try to pick a lock one time and, if the roll fails, may not try the same lock again before gaining an experience level.
- ***Pick Pockets:*** This skill is the bread and butter of non-adventuring thieves; it is a quick (if perilous) source of income. If the victim is above 5th level, the thief's roll is penalised by 5% for every level above 5th. There is always at least a 1% chance of failure. A roll of more than twice the percentage required for success means the intended target notices the thieving attempt. The referee will then roll 2d6 on the reaction table (see [***Encounters***](#encounters)) to determine the target's reaction.

#### [Reaching 9th Level](name:thief_reaching_9th_level)

When a thief attains level 9, he or she can establish a thief den. 2d6 thief apprentices of 1st level will come to work with the character. These thieves will serve the character with some reliability; however, should any be arrested or killed, the character will not be able to attract more followers of this type to replace them. A successful thief might use these followers to start a Thieves' Guild.

### [Dwarf](name:dwarf)

**Requirements**: Minimum CON 9  
**Prime Requisite**: STR  
**Hit Dice**: 1d8  
**Maximum Level**: 12  
**Allowed Armour**: Any, including shields  
**Allowed Weapons**: Small or normal sized (see below)  
**Languages: Alignment** language, Common, dwarvish, gnome, goblin, kobold

Dwarves are stout, bearded demi-humans who average a height of approximately 4 feet and weigh about 150 pounds. Dwarves live underground and value precious metals, fine craftsmanship, and stones. Perhaps not surprisingly, they have skin, hair, and eye colours in earth tones. Dwarves have a reputation for having surly attitudes and are particularly gruff with elves. Dwarves are particularly hardy people and have a strong resistance to magic, as reflected in their saving throws.

#### [Abilities](name:dwarf_abilities)

***Combat:*** Dwarves may use any type of armour, however, due to their short height, may only use small or normal sized weapons. This means that dwarves cannot use longbows or two-handed swords.

***Detect Construction Tricks:*** From their experience underground, dwarves have a 2-in-6 chance of detecting false walls, hidden construction, or sloping passages. A dwarf must be actively searching for these abilities to function.

***Detect Traps:*** Due to their expertise with construction, dwarves have a 2-in-6 chance of detecting non-magical traps, when searching (see [***Searching***](#searching)).

***Infravision:*** Due to their habit of living underground in great mines, dwarves have the ability to see in the dark with infravision up to 60' (see [***Light, Vision, and Visibility***](#light_vision_and_visibility)).

***Listening at Doors:*** Dwarves have a 2-in-6 chance of hearing noises (see [***Doors***](#doors)).

#### [Reaching 9th Level](name:dwarf_reaching_9th_level)

When a dwarf reaches level 9, he or she has the option of creating an underground stronghold that will attract dwarves from far and wide. Dwarves usually live in clans, so dwarves of the character's clan will be attracted to live under his or her roof. Dwarves from other clans will also come and live nearby to be ruled by the character. A dwarf ruler is able to hire dwarven soldiers or mercenaries, but may only hire members of other races for other tasks, such as human alchemists or elves for spell casting.

### [Elf](name:elf)

**Requirements**: Minimum INT 9  
**Prime Requisite**: INT and STR  
**Hit Dice**: 1d6  
**Maximum Level**: 10  
**Allowed Armour**: Any, including shields  
**Allowed Weapons**: Any  
**Languages**: Alignment language, Common, elvish, gnoll, hobgoblin, and orcish

Elves are slender, fey demi-humans with pointed ears. They are very diverse in appearance, much like humans, and there are said to be different kinds of elves in distant locations. They typically weigh about 120 pounds and are between 5 and 5<!-- -->1/2 feet tall. Though a peaceful people who enjoy good, light food and play, elves are very talented fighters and users of magic.

***Prime Requisites:*** An elf must have at least 13 in both prime requisites in order to get the +5% bonus to experience. An elf with an INT of at least 16 and a STR of at least 13 receives a +10% XP bonus.

#### [Abilities](name:elf_abilities)

***Combat:*** Elves are able to use all forms of weapon and armour.

***Detect Secret Doors:*** Elves have keen eyes that allow them, when actively searching, to detect hidden and secret doors with a 2-in-6 chance (see [***Searching***](#searching)).

***Immunity to Ghoul Paralysis:*** Elves are completely unaffected by the paralysis ghouls can inflict.

***Infravision:*** Elves have infravision to 60' (see [***Light, Vision, and Visibility***](#light_vision_and_visibility)).

***Listening at Doors:*** Elves have a 2-in-6 chance of hearing noises (see [***Doors***](#doors)).

***Magical Research:*** An elf of any level may spend time and money to research new spells to add to his or her spell book. When an elf reaches 9th level, he or she is also able to create magic items and research other magical effects. These rules are detailed in [***Magical Research***](#magical_research) section.

***Spell Casting:*** Elves carry spell books that hold the formulae for arcane spells written on their pages. An elf can only memorize a certain number of spells at any given time. The spell casting chart (below) shows both the number of spells in the elf's spell book and the number he or she may memorize, determined by the character's experience level. Thus, a 1st level elf has one spell in his or her spell book, selected by the referee (who may allow the player to choose). The rules for arcane spell casting and spell books are described in the [***Magic***](#magic) section (elves have the same spell selection as magic-users).

***Using Magic Items:*** As spell casters, elves are able to use magic scrolls of spells on their spell list. There are also items (e.g. magic wands) that may only be used by elves or magic-users.

#### [Reaching 9th Level](name:elf_reaching_9th_level)

An elf can establish a stronghold in a natural setting, such as a forest or glen, upon reaching 9th level. Rather than impose upon nature, this keep must blend seamlessly with it. Even if the stronghold is not constructed of stone, the cost is the same due to the quality and artistry of elven craft. Because of the elven connection to nature, all ordinary animals within 5 miles of the stronghold will be kind and helpful to the elves. This helpfulness includes the ability to warn of dangers and pass information or even messages to others nearby. However, in exchange, an elven ruler must always defend the animals within his or her territory. Elven rulers can hire members of other races in the capacity of retainers or specialists, but only soldiers of elven stock may be hired.

### [Halfling](name:halfling)

**Requirements**: Minimum CON and DEX 9  
**Prime Requisite**: DEX and STR  
**Hit Dice**: 1d6  
**Maximum Level**: 8  
**Allowed Armour**: Any appropriate to size, including shields  
**Allowed Weapons**: Appropriate to size (see below)  
**Languages**: Alignment language, Common, halfling

Halflings are small, rotund demi-humans with furry feet and curly hair. They weigh about 60 pounds and only attain a height of around 3 feet. They are as diverse in appearance as humans. Halflings are gentle-natured and value relaxation, good food, and good drink. They love comfort and will spend their riches on the most extravagant items.

***Prime Requisites:*** A halfling must have at least 13 in one or the other prime requisite in order to get a +5% to experience. The character must have a STR and DEX of 13 or higher to get a +10% bonus.

#### [Abilities](name:halfling_abilities)

***Combat:*** Halflings may use any type of armour, though it must be tailored to their small size. Similarly, they may use any weapon which is appropriate to their stature. They cannot use longbows or two-handed swords.

***Defensive Bonus:*** Because they are so small, halflings have a lower Armour Class (&minus;2 bonus) when attacked by creatures greater than human sized.

***Hiding:*** Halflings have an uncanny ability to disappear from sight:

- In bushes or other outdoor cover, a halfling can hide with 90% ability.
- In dungeons, a halfling can also hide in shadows or behind other forms of cover, so long as he or she remains silent and motionless. The chance of success is 2-in-6.

***Initiative Bonus (optional rule):*** If using the optional rule for individual initiative (see [***Basic Combat Procedure***](#basic_combat_procedure)), halflings get a bonus of +1 to initiative rolls.

***Listening at Doors:*** Halflings have a 2-in-6 chance of hearing noises (see [***Doors***](#doors)).

***Missile Attack Bonus:*** Halflings' keen coordination grants them +1 on any missile attacks.

***Stronghold:*** Any time a halfling wishes (and has sufficient money), he or she can build a stronghold. These strongholds will be in serene, beautiful valleys and halflings will come from great distances to settle there. The character becomes the leader of the people (called the sheriff) and must rule them wisely and well.

## [Hit Points](name:roll_hit_points)

Determine your character's hit points by rolling the die type appropriate to the chosen class. Modifiers for high or low Constitution apply (see [***Ability Scores***](#ability_scores)). Your character always starts with at least 1 hit point, regardless of CON modifier.

### [Re-Rolling 1s and 2s (Optional Rule)](name:re_rolling_1s_and_2s)

If your roll for hit points comes up 1 or 2 (_before_ applying any CON modifier), the referee may allow you to re-roll. This is in order to increase the survivability of 1st level PCs.

## [Money and Wealth](name:money_and_wealth)

### [Coinage](name:coinage)

The most common coin is the gold piece (gp). Coins made of other types of precious metals---platinum, electrum, silver, and copper---are also used. Platinum is more valuable than gold: a platinum piece (pp) is worth 5 gold pieces. Coins of the other metals are less valuable than gold: a gold piece is worth 2 electrum pieces (ep), 10 silver pieces (sp), or 100 copper pieces (cp).

#### [Coin Conversion Rates](name:coin_conversion_rates)

### [Starting Money](name:starting_money)

Player characters begin play with 3d6 &times; 10 gold pieces. You may spend as much of this money as you wish to equip your character for adventure, consulting the lists in [***Equipment***](#equipment).

Remember that your chosen class may restrict your use of some equipment (e.g. weapons and armour).

### [Inheritance](name:inheritance)

Faced with the possibility of character death, players may take efforts to ensure the amassed wealth of their PCs is not simply lost if the PC dies. The referee may allow players to create a will for their characters, to leave treasure behind for an heir.

- Any treasure left as an inheritance will be taxed at 10%. (A player might try to leave money to an heir through clandestine means, such as burying it and leaving a map behind, but this is more risky.)
- A character's heir must be a new, 1st level character.
- A player is only allowed to leave a character inheritance one time.

### [Other Equipment](name:other_equipment)

The items detailed in this section are those most commonly available for purchase by adventurers. Should PCs wish to purchase items not on these lists, the referee may use the listed items as guidelines for determining new items' price and characteristics, including combat statistics (if appropriate).

## Combat Details

### [Armour Class](name:note_armour_class)

Your character's Armour Class is determined by two factors:

- The armour worn (see [***Armour***](#armour)). If your character has no armour, his or her base AC is 9.
- Modifiers for high or low Dexterity (see [***Ability Scores***](#ability_scores)).

### [Attack Values](name:note_attack_values)

The level progression chart for your character's class lists the modified attack roll needed to hit an opponent with Armour Class 0. The attack roll you need to hit opponents of other AC ratings can be calculated from this value by subtracting the target AC from the value to hit AC 0.

For example, a character who needs a 17 to hit AC 0 could hit AC 5 on a roll of 12 or greater (17 - 5 = 12).

It is usual to pre-calculate the modified attack values required to hit AC 0--9 and record them in a matrix. 1st level characters need to roll a 19 to hit AC 0, resulting in an attack matrix like this:

Opponent's AC        |  0 |  1 |  2 |  3 |  4 |  5 |  6 |  7 |  8 |  9
---------------------|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----
Attack roll required | 19 | 18 | 17 | 16 | 15 | 14 | 13 | 12 | 11 | 10

### [Saving Throws and Class Abilities](name:note_saving_throws_and_class_abilities)

Record any special abilities possessed by your character as a result of his or her class, as well as your character's saving throws. If your character has a spell book, ask your referee which spells are recorded in it. The referee may allow you to choose.

## [Alignment](name:alignment)

All beings, whether player characters, NPCs, or monsters, adhere to one of three philosophies or spheres of behaviour, known as _alignments_. These spheres are Law, Neutrality, and Chaos. A player must choose one of these paths when his or her character is created.

***Law:*** Lawful beings believe in truth and justice. To this end, they will follow laws and believe all things must adhere to order. Lawful beings also believe in sacrifice to a greater good and will choose the good of a larger group over the good of an individual.

***Neutrality:*** Neutral beings believe in a balance between the ideas of Law and Chaos and, in their actions, they tend to do what will serve themselves. They might commit good or evil acts in order to further their own ends and generally will not put others' needs ahead of their own.

***Chaos:*** Chaotic beings are in direct opposition to Law. These beings should seldom be trusted, for they tend to act in "evil" ways and will be much more selfish than a neutral being. Chaotic characters believe in chance and that there is no innate order to life.

Decide whether your character is Lawful, Neutral, or Chaotic and note this on your character sheet.

### [Player Characters](name:player_characters)

The player must inform the referee of his or her character's alignment, but does not have to tell other players. When determining the character's actions, players should do their best to adhere to their chosen alignment. The referee will take note when behaviour deviates too much and may assign a new alignment more appropriate to actual character actions. Deviation from alignment may also be penalised, as the referee sees fit.

## [Languages](name:languages)

Every character begins play knowing one or more languages, determined by the character's class. Characters with high Intelligence may also choose additional languages.

### [The Common Tongue](name:the_common_tongue)

The common tongue (sometimes simply called _Common_) is a language which is widespread among intelligent species. All player character races---as well as many monsters (see below)---are able to speak Common.

It is assumed that the common tongue is a language common to all humans and used by other intelligent races. However, the referee may rule that different human cultures in the campaign world have different languages, in which case a particular human language must be chosen instead of Common.

### [Alignment Languages](name:alignment_languages)

All intelligent beings know a secret, unwritten language of gestures, signs, and code words associated with their alignment. This secret language allows beings of the same alignment to communicate. Beings of another alignment will recognise when an alignment language is being used, but will not understand. It is not possible to learn another alignment language except by changing alignment, in which case the former language is forgotten.

### [Monster Languages](name:monster_languages)

20% of intelligent monsters speak Common (unless the monster description states otherwise). Many intelligent monster species also have their own tongue.

### [Player Character Languages](name:player_character_languages)

All PCs know the common tongue and their alignment language. Some classes grant further languages, as noted in the class descriptions, and characters with high Intelligence receive additional languages, chosen at the referee's discretion. The following list of languages may be used:

1. Bugbear
2. Doppelg&auml;nger
3. Dragon
4. Dwarvish
5. Elvish
6. Gargoyle
7. Gnoll
8. Gnome
9. Goblin
10. Halfling
11. Harpy
12. Hobgoblin
13. Kobold
14. Lizard man
15. Medusa
16. Minotaur
17. Ogre
18. Orc
19. Pixie
20. Human dialect

## [Character Advancement and Death](name:character_advancement_and_death)

### [Parties of Mixed Levels](name:parties_of_mixed_levels)

As new player characters join play (either due to the death of old characters or due to new players joining the group), the experience levels of the characters in the party may begin to diverge. It is recommended that characters more than four levels apart should adventure separately, as challenges which are suitable for higher level characters will be too dangerous for those of lower level. The opposite is also true: low-level adventures will not provide an interesting challenge to characters of higher level.

### [Level Titles (Optional Rule)](name:level_titles)

In some campaigns, characters are not merely referred to by their numerical experience level (e.g. "2nd level magic-user"), but also gain the right to bear certain titles as they advance in level. Such titles may be granted by the guilds, colleges, or temples that PCs are associates of.

Level titles often vary greatly between campaign worlds, but the following lists may be used as inspiration:

***Cleric:*** Acolyte, Adept, Priest(ess), Vicar, Curate, Elder, Bishop, Lama, Matriarch (Patriarch).

***Dwarf:*** As fighter (e.g. Dwarven Veteran, Dwarven Warrior, etc).

***Elf:*** As fighter and magic-user (e.g. Medium/Veteran, Seer/Warrior, etc).

***Fighter:*** Veteran, Warrior, Swordmaster, Hero, Swashbuckler, Myrmidon, Champion, Superhero, Lord (Lady).

***Halfling:*** As fighter (e.g. Halfling Veteran, Halfling Warrior, etc).

***Magic-User:*** Medium, Seer, Conjurer, Magician, Enchanter (Enchantress), Witch (Warlock), Sorcerer (Sorceress), Necromancer, Wizard.

***Thief:*** Apprentice, Footpad, Robber, Burglar, Cutpurse, Sharper, Pilferer, Thief, Master Thief.

### [High Level Play (Optional Rule)](name:high_level_play)

Human character classes are listed as having a maximum level of 14. This range of levels presents the best play experience, in terms of challenge and reward. Some groups, however, may wish to continue play into the extremely high levels beyond. In this case, human characters may continue advancing to a maximum of 36th level. This must be carefully considered, as PCs of some classes will be left behind, due to their strict level limits. If the referee allows continued play into higher levels, the following guidelines may be used. Additionally, other rule books are available which detail high level play.

Note that however far a character's ability to hit in combat advances, the minimum modified roll required to hit is never less than 2.

***Clerics*** require an additional 100,000 XP per level beyond 14th and gain 1 hit point per level gained. Their chance to hit in combat improves by 2 every 4 levels. Spells of higher levels become available as the character advances.

***Fighters*** require an additional 120,000 XP per level beyond 14th and gain 2 hit points per level gained. Their chance to hit in combat improves by 2 every 3 levels. Fighters of 20th level may make two attacks per round. This increases to three attacks per round at 25th level and four per round at 30th level.

***Magic-users*** require an additional 150,000 XP per level beyond 14th and gain 1 hit point per level gained. Their chance to hit in combat improves by 2 every 5 levels. Spells of higher levels become available as the character advances.

***Thieves*** require an additional 120,000 XP per level beyond 14th and gain 2 hit points per level gained. Their chance to hit in combat improves by 2 every 4 levels. Additional skills become available to high level thieves, including the ability to climb upside down or horizontally, voice skills such as mimicry and ventriloquism, and other skills of deception.

# [Magic](name:magic)

## [Spells](name:spells)

Some character classes have the ability to memorize and cast magical spells. There are two types of magic: **divine magic**, which a deity or higher power grants, and **arcane magic**, which is learned by esoteric study.

## [Memorizing Spells](name:memorizing_spells)

A spell consists of a pattern of magical energy stored in a character's mind. A spell caster is able to memorize a certain number of spells of different spell levels, depending on his or her experience level. A character can memorize the same spell more than once if he or she is capable of memorizing more than one spell of the given level.

Arcane spell casters memorize spells from spell books and are thus limited to choosing from the spells in their spell book, which must be to hand.

Divine spell casters do not study from books, but instead receive the knowledge of how to cast spells through prayer to their gods. When praying for spells, divine spell casters have access to all spells in their class' spell list that they are of high enough level to cast.

### [Rest and Time Requirements](name:rest_and_time_requirements)

All spell casters can memorize new spells after an uninterrupted night's sleep. It takes one hour to memorize all spells the character is capable of learning.

## [Casting Spells](name:casting_spells)

A memorized spell may be cast by precisely replicating the required set of hand gestures and mystical spoken words. When a spell is cast, knowledge of the spell is erased from the mind of the caster.

### [Spell Casting Constraints](name:spell_casting_constraints)

All spell casters need to be able to move their hands and speak in order to make the gestures and speak the magical phrases that bring magic effects into being. As a result, a spell caster cannot cast spells if gagged, bound, or in an area of magical silence.

When casting spells in combat, it is possible for spell casting to be disrupted. See [***Basic Combat Procedure***](#basic_combat_procedure).

## [Reversible Spells](name:reversible_spells)

Some spells are reversible; this is indicated in each spell's description.

For arcane spell casters, the normal or reversed form of a spell must be selected when the spell is memorized. An arcane spell caster may memorize both forms of a spell, if he or she is able to memorize more than one spell of the given level.

A divine spell caster can use either form of a spell without having to pray for the different versions separately; the character may decide which version (normal or reversed) to use when the spell is cast. However, a divine spell caster may draw dissatisfaction from his or her deity when casting spells (or their reversed versions) whose effects go against the deity's alignment.

## [Cumulative Spell Effects](name:cumulative_spell_effects)

Multiple spells cannot be used to increase the same ability (e.g. bonuses to attack rolls, Armour Class, damage rolls, saving throws, etc.). Spells that affect _different_ abilities can be combined. In addition, spells can be combined with the effects of magical items.

## [Spell Books](name:spell_books)

Arcane spell casters record the spells that they know in a spell book (or set of spell books). A character's spell book contains exactly the number of spells that the character is capable of memorizing. For example, a character who is able to memorize two 1st level spells and one 2nd level spell would have exactly that number of spells in his or her spell book.

### [Lost Spell Books](name:lost_spell_books)

Sometimes a spell book will either be lost or destroyed. An arcane spell caster can rewrite the spells through research and memory at a cost of 1 week of game time and 1,000 gp for each spell level. For instance, if two first level spells and one 2nd level spell are replaced, it will take 4 weeks and 4,000 gp. This activity requires complete concentration and a character doing this work may not engage in any other activity for the time required.

### [Captured Spell Books](name:captured_spell_books)

Each arcane spell caster's spell books are written in such a way that only the owner is able to read the spells without the use of _read magic_.

### [Beginning Spells](name:beginning_spells)

Arcane spell casters begin play with one 1st level spell in their spell book. The referee may choose this spell or may allow the player to select one.

### [Adding Spells](name:adding_spells)

When an arcane spell caster gains a level, he or she may consult a wizard's guild or mentor to learn new spells. In this way, the character can add spells to his or her spell books, so that the books contain the same number of spells the characters is able to cast. This process takes about a week of game time. (The spells a character learns in this way are determined by the referee, who may decide to let the player to choose.)

It is also possible to add spells to a spell book by means of [***Magical Research***](#magical_research).

## [Magic Items](name:magic_items)

### [Identifying](name:identifying)

Most magic items are not labelled, so characters must discover their exact properties through trial and error. Powerful wizards may be able to identify magic items, but it can take many weeks to do so. Alchemists are also able to identify some items, such as potions.

### [Using](name:using)

In order to use a magic item, a character must follow the procedures indicated in the item's description. The item must be worn or held in the usual manner. Some magic items (e.g. an enchanted suit of armour) are always active, but others must be consciously activated--this requires a round of concentration, during which the character may do nothing else. Some items have special activation conditions, such as command words.

### [Charges](name:magic_item_charges)

Some magic items have limited uses, called "charges". Each charge can be spent to bring about one instance of the item's magical effect. A character cannot know how many charges an item has and, when the charges are all spent, the item becomes a normal, non-magical object--it cannot be recharged.

### [Cursed Items](name:cursed_items)

Cursed items, once possessed by a character, can only be disposed of if the curse is dispelled by magic. The owner of a cursed item will not believe the item is cursed and will resist efforts to get rid of the item until the curse is dispelled.

### [Magic Weapons](name:magic_weapons)

Magic weapons follow the same class restrictions as normal weapons. A magic weapon has a "+" value, indicating the degree of its enchantment. This value is applied to attack and damage rolls using the weapon.

### [Cursed Weapons](name:cursed_weapons)

Cursed weapons have the opposite effect, incurring penalties to attack and damage equal to the "+" value specified. The possessor of a cursed weapon will prefer to use this weapon in combat above any other weapon.

### [Magic Armour](name:magic_armour)

Magic armour follows the same class restrictions as normal armour. A suit of magical armour has a "+" value indicating its degree of enchantment. The wearer's AC is improved (i.e. reduced) by the "+" value.

Magic armour is also lighter and less cumbersome than normal. When using the optional rule for encumbrance by weight carried (see [***Encumbrance***](#encumbrance)), enchanted leather armour weighs 75 coins, chainmail 150 coins, and plate mail 200 coins.

### [Cursed Armour](name:cursed_armour)

Cursed armour appears to be armour +1, but actually has an Armour Class rating of 9. It has the same weight as normal, non-magical armour of the same type.

### [Potions](name:potions)

Most potions are found as a single dose that imbues the potion's effects on one individual. Potions usually bear no label and vary in their appearance, aroma, etc. Even two potions of the same type will differ. A potion may be identified by sampling a small amount.

Unless a potion's description specifies otherwise, potions take effect in the same round as their consumption and last for 1d6+6 turns.

### [Mixing Potions](name:mixing_potions)

If a potion is consumed while the character is still under the effects of another potion, the effects of both potions are nullified and the character becomes sick, unable to do anything for three turns.

### [Scrolls](name:scrolls)

Scrolls are pieces of parchment, imbued with potent magical writings. Simply pronouncing the words releases their power.

Some scrolls can be deciphered and read by any class, while others have restrictions. Scrolls that contain arcane spells can only be read by an arcane spell caster employing the spell read magic. Scrolls with divine spells can be read without special deciphering, but are usable only by divine spell casters.

Once a scroll is used, the magical writing disappears. (In the case of scrolls containing multiple spells, only the spell cast disappears.)

### [Rings](name:rings)

Magical rings are usable by any character class. They must be worn on a finger or thumb. It is only possible to wear two magical rings: one on each hand. If more than two are worn, none of them will function.

### [Cursed Rings](name:cursed_rings)

Cursed rings are always active. Their effects are not nullified, no matter how many other rings are worn.

### [Rods, Staves, and Wands](name:rods_staves_and_wands)

Rods are generally usable by characters of any class. Wands are only usable by arcane spell casters. Staves are only usable by spell casters--either divine or arcane, depending on the item.

These magic items generally have a limited number of "charges" which are spent to trigger the item's magical effect. When found, a rod has 1d10 charges, a wand has 2d10 charges, and a staff has 3d10 charges.

## [Magical Research](name:magical_research)

### [Creating New Spells](name:creating_new_spells)

Spell casting characters of any level are able to research and create new spells. The player must describe in detail the kind of spell he or she wants to create and the effects it has. The referee will then decide if the spell can be created and, if so, what the spell level will be. The character must be capable of casting spells of the spell level the potential new spell will be, otherwise the player must wait until the character attains a high enough level to research and cast the spell. If the character can create the spell, it will take two weeks of game time and 1,000 gp per spell level.

### [Magic Item Creation](name:magic_item_creation)

A spell casting character of 9th level or higher may attempt to create magical items. Divine spell casters may only create items usable by their class, while arcane spell casters may create any item except those that may only be used by divine spell casters. The player should inform the referee of the item that he or she wishes to construct and the referee will decide whether this is possible and, if so, what kinds of materials are required. Materials will often include rare components such as expensive and hard to obtain gems or ingredients from rare animals and monsters. Often, the character will have to go on adventures just to acquire these materials.

Many magic items duplicate the effects of a spell, generally costing one week of game time and 500 gp per level of the mimicked spell. If the item created can replicate the spell effect multiple times (for example a wand with charges), the cost in time and money is multiplied by the number of uses.

Some magic items do not mimic spell effects precisely and for these the referee will have to use discretion. The more powerful the item, the more difficult it should be to construct. As a general rule, items should cost from 10,000 to 100,000 gp and from 1 month to 1 year of game time to complete. Some examples are: a dagger +1 (2 months, 10,000 gp), chainmail armour +1 (4 months, 10,000 gp), a displacer cloak (100,000 gp, 1 year).

### [Other Magical Research](name:other_magical_research)

Other kinds of magic effects--for which a magic item or spell is not appropriate--may be researched. Creating magic traps, magical constructs, magical portals, or other effects will need to be given a gp cost and time cost at the referee's discretion.

### [Chance of Failure](name:chance_of_failure)

No attempt to create a magic item, spell, or other effect is guaranteed to succeed. There is a minimum probability of 15% that any such endeavour fails. This chance may be raised depending on the circumstances. The referee rolls for failure after the character has spent the money and time on the project--these are lost regardless of the result.

**Duration:** Instant  
**Range:** The cleric or a creature touched

This spell has two uses:

Inflicts 1d6+1 hit points of damage to a touched creature. In combat, a melee attack roll is required.

### [Detect Evil](name:cleric_detect_evil)

**Duration:** 6 turns  
**Range:** 120'

Objects enchanted for evil purposes or living beings with evil intentions are caused to magically glow.

- This spell does not grant the ability to read minds, but only grants a general sense of evil intent.
- The referee must decide what is "evil". Some things that are potentially harmful, like traps, are not "evil."

### [Detect Magic](name:cleric_detect_magic)

**Duration:** 2 turns  
**Range:** 60'

Enchanted objects, areas, or creatures are caused to glow. Both permanent and temporary enchantments are revealed.

### [Light](name:cleric_light)

**Range:** 120'

2. Blinding a creature by casting the spell upon its eyes. If the target fails a **saving throw versus spells**, it is blinded for the duration. A blind creature cannot attack.
3. Cancelling a _darkness_ spell (see below).

[**Reversed: Darkness**](name:cleric_darkness)

Creates a 15' radius area of magical blackness, preventing normal sight (but not infravision). Like _light_, it may alternatively be used to blind creatures or to dispel a _light_ spell.

- Affected creatures' attacks against the cleric are penalised by &minus;1.

Additionally, the spell prevents enchanted, constructed, or summoned creatures from attacking the cleric in melee, though they may still make ranged attacks.

### [Purify Food and Water](name:purify_food_and_water)

**Duration:** Permanent  
**Range:** 10'

This spell makes spoiled, rotten, poisonous, or otherwise contaminated food and water pure and suitable for eating and drinking. One of the following may be affected:

### [Remove Fear](name:remove_fear)

**Duration:** 2 turns

Will cause a target within 120' to flee for the duration unless it **saves versus spells**.

**Duration:** 6 turns  
**Range:** 60'

May be used in one of two ways:

[**Reversed: Blight**](name:blight)

Incurs a &minus;1 penalty to morale checks, attacks rolls, and damage rolls of enemies within a 20' square area. A **save versus spells** is allowed to resist the _blight_.

### [Know Alignment](name:know_alignment)

**Duration:** 1 round  
**Range:** 10'

**Duration:** 2 turns  
**Range:** 30'

A single creature is bestowed with supernatural resistance to fire, as follows:

- Unharmed by non-magical heat or fire.
- Gain a +2 bonus to all saving throws versus fire-based magical or breath attacks.
- Fire-based damage is reduced by 1 point per damage die rolled. (Each die inflicts a minimum of 1 hit point damage.)

### [Silence 15' Radius](name:silence)

**Range:** 180'

A 15' radius area is rendered utterly silent.

- All sound is stopped and conversation and spell casting areimpossible.
- Noise originating from outside the silenced area can be heard by those within it.
- _Silence_ may be cast upon a creature, which must **save versus spells**. If the save fails, the 15' radius area of _silence_ moves with the creature. If the save succeeds, the spell's effect remains stationary---the targeted creature may move out of it.

**Duration:** 1d4+1 rounds or turns  
**Range:** 60'

One or more snakes are rendered non-hostile, rearing up and swaying to and fro but not attacking.

2. Blinding a creature by casting the spell upon its eyes. If the target fails a **saving throw versus spells**, it is blinded. A blind creature cannot attack.
3. Cancelling a _continual darkness_ spell (see below).

[**Reversed: Continual Darkness**](name:cleric_continual_darkness)

Creates a 30' radius area of magical blackness, preventing both normal sight and infravision. Light sources brought within the area of darkness do not illuminate it. Like _continual light_, it may alternatively be used to blind creatures or to dispel a _continual light_ spell.

This disease can be cured with a casting of _cure disease_.

**Duration:** 12 turns  
**Range:** 120'

One non-magical, normal animal is doubled in size when this spell is cast upon it.

- The animal's strength is doubled, along with the damage inflicted by its attacks and the amount of weight it can carry.

### [Locate Object](name:cleric_locate_object)

**Duration:** 6 turns  
**Range:** 120'

The cleric can sense the direction (but not distance) of an object. One of two types of object may be located:

1. An object of a general class (e.g. a stairway, an altar, etc). In this case, the nearest object of that type is located.
2. A specific object which the cleric can clearly visualise in all aspects.

This spell cannot be used to locate creatures.

### [Remove Curse](name:cleric_remove_curse)

### [Speak with Plants](name:speak_with_plants)

**Duration:** 3 turns  
**Range:** 30'

This spell has two uses:

1. Communication with normal plants. The cleric is able to ask questions and receive answers and may ask for simple favours.

### [Dispel Evil](name:dispel_evil)

**Duration:** Concentration (up to 1 turn) or instant (see below)  
**Range:** 30'

This spell has three uses:

1. By concentrating and remaining stationary, enchanted or undead monsters that come within range may be banished or destroyed. Each monster may **save versus spells** to avoid banishment or destruction. If a monster's save succeeds, it flees the affected area.
2. Instantly banish or destroy a single enchanted or undead monster within range. The monster may **save versus spells (with a &minus;2 penalty)** to avoid banishment or destruction. If the monster's save succeeds, it flees the affected area.

- Moves at 20' per round. While the swarm is within range, the cleric is able to direct its movements.
- Vision within the area of the swarm is obscured.
- Creatures of 2 HD or less are driven away, if caught within the swarm.

If the cleric moves or loses concentration, the swarm dissipates, ending the spell.

The spell has no effect if cast underground.

### [Quest](name:quest)

**Duration:** Until quest is completed / Instant  
**Range:** 30'

The cleric commands a single subject to perform a specific quest or task.

- Examples of quests include: rescuing a prisoner, killing a specific monster, bringing a magic item to the cleric, or going on a journey to a holy site.
- The prescribed quest must not be obviously suicidal.
- The subject may **save versus spells**, with success indicating that the quest has no effect.
- Otherwise, the subject must undertake the quest or fall under a curse (per the curse spell, with the exact nature of the curse determined by the referee).
- Once the task is completed, the spell ends.

[**Reversed: Remove Quest**](name:remove_quest)

Can dispel an active _quest_ spell. If the cleric who cast the _quest_ spell to be nullified is higher level than the cleric casting _remove quest_, there is a chance of the spell having no effect. The probability of failure is 5% per level the cleric is below the caster of _quest_.

### [Raise Dead](name:raise_dead)

**Duration:** Instant  
**Range:** 120'

This spell has two uses:

1. Restore life to a recently deceased human or demihuman. The cleric can raise a person that has been dead for no longer than four days per level of the cleric above 7th. For example, a 10th level cleric can revive a character that has been dead for twelve days (three levels above 7th × four days). Coming back from the dead is an ordeal. Until the subject gets two full weeks of bed rest, he or she has 1 hit point, moves at half the normal rate, cannot carry heavy items, and cannot attack, cast spells, or use other class abilities. This period of weakness may not be shortened by any magical healing.
2. Destroy an undead monster, if it fails a **saving throw versus spells**.

[**Reversed: Finger of Death**](name:finger_of_death)

Directs a ray of deadly magic at a single target. If the target fails a **saving throw versus death**, it dies instantly. Casting _finger of death_ is a chaotic act; it will only be used by lawful clerics in desperate situations.

## 1st Level Magic-User Spells

### [Charm Person](name:charm_person)

**Duration:** One or more days (see below)  
**Range:** 120'

A single, humanoid creature must **save versus spells** or be charmed, as follows:

- The subject regards the caster as its trusted friend and ally and will come to the caster's defence.
- If they share a language, the caster may give the charmed creature commands, which it will obey.
- Actions that the charmed creature wouldn't ordinarily do, based on its nature or alignment, may be abstained from.
- An affected creature never obeys suicidal or obviously harmful orders.

Humanoids of greater than 4+1 HD and undead are not affected.

The charm lasts indefinitely, but the subject is allowed to make further **saves vs spells** at intervals. If one of these saves succeeds, the spell ends.

- A creature with an INT score of 3--8 gains a new save once every month.
- A creature with an INT of 9--12 gains a new save each week
- A creature with an INT of 13--18 gains a new save once every day.

### [Light](name:magic_user_light)

**Duration:** 6 turns +1 per level  
**Range:** 120'

This spell has three usages:

1. Conjuring light in a 15' radius. The magical light is sufficient for reading, but is not as bright as daylight. The spell may be cast upon an object, in which case, the light moves with the object.
2. Blinding a creature by casting the spell upon its eyes. If the target fails a **saving throw versus spells**, it is blinded for the duration. A blind creature cannot attack.
3. Cancelling a _darkness_ spell (see below).

[**Reversed: Darkness**](name:magic_user_darkness)

Creates a 15' radius area of magical blackness, preventing normal sight (but not infravision). Like _light_, it may alternatively be used to blind creatures or to dispel a _light_ spell.

### [Magic Missile](name:magic_missile)

**Duration:** 1 turn  
**Range:** 150'

This spell conjures a glowing dart of energy that the caster may choose to shoot at a visible target within range.

**Range:** The caster

This spell wards the caster from attacks by creatures of another alignment, as follows:

- The caster gains a +1 bonus to saving throws against attacks or special abilities of affected creatures.
- Affected creatures' attacks against the caster are penalised by &minus;1.

Additionally, the spell prevents enchanted, constructed, or summoned creatures from attacking the caster in melee, though they may still make ranged attacks. If the caster engages such a creature in melee, this protection is broken (the caster still gains the bonuses to saving throws and attack rolls mentioned above).

### [Read Languages](name:read_languages)

**Duration:** 2 turns  
**Range:** The caster

For the duration of this spell, the caster may read any language, coded message, map, or other set of written instructions. This spell does not grant any ability to speak unknown languages.

### [Read Magic](name:read_magic)

**Duration:** 1 turn  
**Range:** The caster

By means of _read magic_, the caster can decipher magical inscriptions or runes, as follows:

- The magical script of a scroll of arcane spells can be understood. The caster is then able to activate the scroll at any time in the future.
- A spell book written by another arcane spell caster can be deciphered.
- Runes or magical words inscribed on an object or surface can be understood.

Once the caster has read a magical inscription using _read magic_, he or she is thereafter able to read that particular writing without recourse to the use of this spell.

### [Shield](name:shield)

**Duration:** 2 turns  
**Range:** The caster

_Shield_ creates an invisible field of force that protects the caster, granting an AC of 2 against missile attacks and AC 4 against other attacks.

**Duration:** 4d4 turns  
**Range:** 240'

A _sleep_ spell causes a magical slumber to come upon creatures, excluding the undead. The spell may target either:

- A single creature with 4+1 Hit Dice.
- A total of 2d8 Hit Dice of creatures of 4 HD or lower each.

When targeting creatures of 4 HD or less, the following rules apply:

- Targets with the least HD are affected first.
- Calculate monsters with less than 1 HD as having 1 HD and monsters with a bonus to HD as having the flat amount. (For example, a 3+2 HD monster would be calculated as having 3 HD.)
- Rolled Hit Dice that are not sufficient to affect a creature are wasted.

Creatures enchanted by this spell are helpless and can be killed instantly with a bladed weapon. Slapping or wounding awakens an affected creature.

### [Ventriloquism](name:ventriloquism)

**Range:** 60'

The caster may make his or her voice appear to come from any location or source (e.g. a statue or animal) within the spell's range.

## 2nd Level Magic-User Spells

### [Continual Light](name:magic_user_continual_light)

**Duration:** Permanent  
**Range:** 120'

This spell has three usages:

1. Conjuring light in a 30' radius. The magical light is sufficient for reading, but is not as bright as daylight. The spell may be cast upon an object, in which case, the light moves with the object.
2. Blinding a creature by casting the spell upon its eyes. If the target fails a **saving throw versus spells**, it is blinded. A blind creature cannot attack.
3. Cancelling _continual darkness_.

[**Reversed: Continual Darkness**](name:magic_user_continual_darkness)

Creates a 30' radius area of magical blackness, preventing both normal sight and infravision. Light sources brought within the area of darkness do not illuminate it. Like _continual light_, it may alternatively be used to blind creatures or to dispel a _continual light_ spell.

### [Detect Evil](name:magic_user_detect_evil)

**Duration:** 2 turns  
**Range:** 60'

Objects enchanted for evil purposes or living beings with evil intentions are caused to magically glow.

- To pick up thoughts, the caster must focus his or her concentration in one particular direction for one turn.
- After this turn, the thoughts of all creatures within range in that direction can be perceived.
- If multiple creatures are within the range in the direction being focused on, their thoughts mingle into a confusing jumble. The caster must spend an additional turn to sort out one creature's thoughts.
- The caster understands the meaning of all thoughts even if he or she does not share the creature's language.
- The ability to perceive thoughts is obstructed by a thin layer of lead or by rock of 2' thick or greater.

### [Invisibility](name:invisibility)

**Duration:** Permanent (but may be broken, see below)  
**Range:** 240'

The caster or another creature or object within range becomes invisible:

- If cast on a creature, any gear the subject is carrying is also rendered invisible (this includes clothing and armour). Items dropped or put down by an invisible creature become visible. If the subject attacks or casts a spell, the invisibility is broken, ending the spell.
- If cast on an object, the invisibility is permanent.
- Note that if a light source is made invisible (either as part of a creature's gear or as an individual object), the light it casts is unaffected.

### [Knock](name:knock)

**Duration:** 1 round  
**Range:** 60'

The _knock_ spell opens stuck, barred, or locked doors, gates, chests, and so forth.

### [Locate Object](name:magic_user_locate_object)

**Duration:** 2 turns  
**Range:** 60' +10' per level

The caster can sense the direction (but not distance) of an object. One of two types of object may be located:

1. An object of a general class (e.g. a stairway, an altar, etc). In this case, the nearest object of the type is located.
2. A specific object known to the caster.

This spell cannot be used to locate creatures.

### [Mirror Image](name:mirror_image)

**Duration:** Concentration  
**Range:** 240'

An illusion of the caster's choosing manifests in a 20' cube area. Three types of illusion may be created:

1. An illusionary monster that can be directed to attack. The monster has an Armour Class of 9 and will vanish if hit in combat.
2. An illusionary attack of some kind (an avalanche, a falling ceiling, a magic missile, etc). Targets who **save versus spells** are unaffected.
3. A scene of some kind, either changing the appearance of the affected area or creating the appearance of something new. The scene disappears if touched.

The following stipulations apply:

- Concentration is required to maintain the illusion: if the caster moves or is affected by an attack, the spell ends.
- Illusionary monsters or attacks may appear to be harmful but no real damage is ever inflicted. A character who appears to die actually falls unconscious, a character turned to stone will actually be paralysed, and so on. Such effects last for 1d4 turns.
- If the illusion is of something the caster has not personally seen, the referee should grant targets a bonus to any applicable saving throws.

### [Web](name:web)

**Range:** 10'

_Web_ conjures a many-layered mass of strong, sticky threads, blocking a 10' cube area. Creatures caught within a web become entangled among the gluey fibers. Entangled creatures can't move, but can break free depending on their strength:

- A creature with strength in the normal human range can break free in 2d4 turns.
- A creature with magically augmented strength above 18 can break free in 4 rounds.
- A creature of giant strength can break free in two rounds.

The strands of the web are flammable and can be destroyed by fire in two rounds. All creatures caught within flaming webs suffer 1d6 points of damage from the flames.

### [Wizard Lock](name:wizard_lock)

**Duration:** Permanent  
**Range:** 10'

A _wizard lock_ spell magically locks a door, gate, similar portal, or any item that has a lock. The magical lock is permanent but may be bypassed as follows:

- A [_knock_](#knock) spell allows passage.
- Any magic-using character who is at least 3 levels higher than the caster of the _wizard lock_ may pass through unimpeded.

Bypassing a _wizard lock_ does not destroy it.

## 3rd Level Magic-User Spells

- Those warded gain a +1 bonus to saving throws against attacks or special abilities of affected creatures.
- Affected creatures' attacks against those warded are penalised by &minus;1.

Additionally, the spell prevents enchanted, constructed, or summoned creatures from making melee attacks against those warded, though they may still make ranged attacks. If any of the warded party engages such a creature in melee, this protection is broken (those warded still gain the bonuses to saving throws and attack rolls mentioned above).

### [Protection from Normal Missiles](name:protection_from_normal_missiles)

- If they share a language, the caster may give the charmed creature commands, which it will obey.
- Actions that the charmed creature wouldn't ordinarily do, based on its nature or alignment, may be abstained from.
- An affected creature never obeys suicidal or obviously harmful orders.

## 5th Level Magic-User Spells

### [Animate Dead](name:animate_dead)

**Duration:** Permanent

- They obey the caster's commands.
- They are unable to use any special abilities (including spell casting) that they possessed in life.

The spell animates a number of HD of zombies or skeletons equal to the caster's level:

- A skeleton has AC 7 and Hit Dice equal to those the creature had in life.
- A zombie has AC 8 and Hit Dice one greater than it had in life.
- If a PC or NPC with levels in a class is reanimated by this spell, the levels are not counted as HD. For example, the reanimated corpse of a 5th level fighter would have 2 HD (1 HD as a normal human, +1 for being reanimated as a zombie).

### [Cloudkill](name:cloudkill)

**Duration:** 6 turns  
**Range:** 30'

A poisonous fog streams from the caster's fingertips, filling a 30' diameter area.

- The fog moves at 60' per turn (20' per round), driven by the wind (or away from the caster, in still conditions).
- Because the fog is heavier than air, it sinks to the lowest level of the land, even pouring down den or sinkhole openings.
- All creatures in contact with the vapours suffer 1 hit point of damage per round of contact. Creatures with less than 5 Hit Dice must also **save versus death** (also once per round of contact) or die.

### [Conjure Elemental](name:conjure_elemental)

**Duration:** Permanent (until dismissed or slain)  
**Range:** 240'

A 16 Hit Dice [elemental](#elemental) is summoned from an elemental plane of the caster's choice (air, earth, fire, water) to do his or her bidding.

- A large volume of the appropriate element is required for the summons to work.
- Commanding an elemental requires great concentration: the caster may not take part in combat, cast other spells, or move at greater than half speed.
- While control over the elemental is maintained, the caster may dismiss it at any time, sending it back to its plane of origin.
- If the caster's concentration is disturbed, the spell's command of the elemental ends. It is, henceforth, a free-willed entity and will immediately try to kill the caster and any who get in its way.
- A conjured elemental may be dispelled by [_dispel magic_](#dispel_magic) or [_dispel evil_](#dispel_evil).
- The caster may summon at most one elemental from each plane in a single day.

### [Contact Higher Plane](name:contact_higher_plane)

**Duration:** One conversation  
**Range:** The caster

A channel of communication is opened to a higher plane of existence, allowing the caster to ask powerful, otherworldly beings for advice and knowledge on any subject.

- The caster must choose which plane of existence to contact: communion with beings of the 3rd to 12th planes is possible via this spell. Higher numbered planes are home to more powerful and knowledgeable beings.
- The caster may then ask a number of simple yes/no questions equal to the number of the plane contacted. The referee plays the role of the contacted being, responding to the caster's questions.
- For each question asked, there is a chance of the contacted being not knowing the answer or of answering untruthfully: see the chart below. (It is impossible to detect whether the entity is lying.)

Casting _contact higher plane_ is a great and perilous deed.

- It may be cast at most once per week. (The referee may limit the spell's usage to even less frequently, if desired.)
- Communion with otherworldly beings of great power can shatter the caster's sanity. The basic chance is shown in the chart above. For every level of the caster above 11, this chance is reduced by 5%. If the caster is driven insane as a result of the communion, the recovery time is a number of weeks equal to the number of the plane contacted.

Plane | #Questions | Don't Know | Truth | Insanity
----|---|-----|-----|-----
3rd | 3 | 75% | 50% | 5%
4th | 4 | 70% | 55% | 10%
5th | 5 | 65% | 60% | 15%
6th | 6 | 60% | 65% | 20%
7th | 7 | 50% | 70% | 25%
8th | 8 | 40% | 75% | 30%
9th | 9 | 30% | 80% | 35%
10th | 10 | 20% | 85% | 40%

**Duration:** Special  
**Range:** The caster

The caster's body enters a comatose trance as his or her life-force is transferred into a receptacle (any inanimate object within 30'), known as a _magic jar_. From there, the caster may attempt to possess the bodies of other creatures.

The following stipulations apply, when the caster's life-force is ***in the magic jar***:

- The caster may attempt to possess the body of another creature within 120'. The victim may **save versus spells** to resist possession. If the save is successful, the caster may not make another attempt to possess that victim for one turn. If the save fails, the caster's life-force leaves the _magic jar_ and enters the victim, possessing it.
- The caster may choose to return to his or her own body at any time, ending the spell.
- If the _magic jar_ is destroyed, the caster dies.
- If the caster's own body is destroyed, his or her life-force is stranded in the _magic jar_.

The following stipulations apply, when the caster's life-force is ***possessing a victim***:

- The caster gains full control over the victim's body, but is not able to make the victim cast spells.
- If the _magic jar_ is destroyed, the spell ends and the caster's life-force is trapped in the possessed body.
- If the possessed victim is killed, the caster's life-force returns to the _magic jar_.

**Duration:** Instant  
**Range:** 10'

The caster or a chosen creature vanishes and reappears at a location of the caster's choice.

- The subject is teleported with all its gear, up to its maximum encumbrance load.
- An unwilling subject may **save versus spells** to prevent the teleportation.
- The selected destination may be at any distance, but must be known to the caster and an open space at ground level. (It is not possible to intentionally teleport the subject into mid-air or into solid matter.)

There is a risk, when teleporting, of accidentally arriving above or below ground level. The chance of a successful teleportation depends on the caster's knowledge of the destination (see below). Roll d% and consult the following chart:

Knowledge of Destination | Ground Level | Too High | Too Low
-------------------------|--------------|----------|--------
Scant | 01--50 | 51--75 | 76--00
Moderate | 01--80 | 81--90 | 91--00
Exact | 01--95 | 96--99 | 00

- ***Ground level:*** The subject appears at the desired destination.
- ***Too high:*** The subject appears 1d10×10 feet above the intended destination. Should this location already be occupied by solid matter, the subject is instantly killed. Otherwise, the subject falls (suffering 1d6 damage per 10' fallen).
- ***Too low:*** The subject appears in the ground and is killed instantly.

The caster's knowledge of the destination is rated as follows:

- ***Scant:*** A location that the caster has visited once or twice, has seen by magical scrying, or has heard of from descriptions.
- ***Moderate:*** A location that the caster has visited often or has studied via scrying for several weeks.
- ***Exact:*** A location that the caster has made a detailed study of, in person.

[**Reversed: Transmute Mud to Rock**](name:transmute_mud_to_rock)

Changes an area of mud---up to 3,000 square feet and up to 10' deep---into rock. This alteration is permanent.

### [Wall of Stone](name:wall_of_stone)

**Duration:** Permanent  
**Range:** 60'

A wall of solid rock springs into existence.

- The wall may be of whatever shape the caster desires and is of 1,000 cubic feet in volume. (For example, a 2' thick wall, 50' long and 10' high.)
- The wall must rest upon a solid surface and may not be evoked so that it appears where objects are.

## 6th Level Magic-User Spells

### [Anti-Magic Shell](name:anti_magic_shell)

**Duration:** 12 turns  
**Range:** The caster

An anti-magic barrier is created around the caster. No spells or spell effects can pass through this barrier, whether from inside or outside. The caster may end this spell at any time before the duration has expired.

### [Control Weather](name:control_weather)

**Duration:** Concentration  
**Range:** 240 yards around the caster

By concentrating (no movement allowed), the caster causes one of the following conditions to manifest around him or her. This spell only functions outdoors.

- ***Calm:*** Clears bad weather (though side-effects---e.g. mud after rain---remain.)
- ***Extreme heat:*** Dries up snow or mud (including _transmute rock to mud_). Creatures in the area move at half normal rate.
- ***Foggy:*** Visibility drops to 20'. Creatures in the fog move at half their normal rate. At the referee's option, they may also have a chance of getting lost.
- ***High winds:*** Movement rates are halved. Missile fire and flight are impossible. At sea, may be used to increase the sailing speed of ships by 50%, if they travel with the wind. In sandy areas, may cause a sandstorm, reducing visibility to 20'.
- ***Rainy:*** &minus;2 penalty to missile attacks. Mud forms in 3 turns, halving movement rates.
- ***Snowy:*** Visibility drops to 20'. Movement rates are halved. Bodies of water may freeze. After the snow thaws, mud remains and still impedes movement.
- ***Tornado:*** The caster can direct the tornado, which moves at 120' per round. The tornado can be directed to attack, using the stats for a 12 HD [air elemental](#air_elemental). Ships caught in a tornado have a 75% chance of suffering 12 points of hull damage.

### [Death Spell](name:death_spell)

**Duration:** Instant  
**Range:** 240'

Up to 4d8 Hit Dice of creatures within a 60' cube area must **save versus death or die**, instantly. Undead and creatures with greater than 7 Hit Dice are unaffected.

### [Disintegrate](name:disintegrate)

**Duration:** Instant  
**Range:** 60'

The material form of a single, non-magical creature or object is unwoven, causing it to instantly and permanently cease to exist.

- If a creature is targeted, it may **save versus death** to resist disintegration.
- Examples of objects that might be targeted: a tree, a ship, a 10' section of wall.

### [Geas](name:geas)

**Duration:** Permanent / Instant  
**Range:** 30'

The caster commands a subject to perform or avoid performing a specific action.

- Examples include: bringing a specific item to the caster, eating or drinking without restraint, keeping a certain fact secret.
- The prescribed _geas_ must not be impossible or directly deadly---if such a _geas_ is cast, it affects the caster, instead.
- The subject may **save versus spells**, to avoid coming under the spell's effect.
- If the save fails, the subject must follow the stipulated course of action or suffer gradually increasing (and eventually fatal) penalties determined by the referee. For example: penalties to attack, ability score reductions, inability to memorize spells, physical torment and feebleness, etc.

[**Reversed: Remove Geas**](name:remove_geas)

Can dispel an active _geas_ spell and any incurred penalties. If the caster of the _geas_ to be nullified is higher level than the character casting _remove geas_, there is a chance of the spell having no effect. The probability of spell failure is 5% per level the caster is below the caster of _geas_.

### [Invisible Stalker](name:invisible_stalker)

**Duration:** One mission  
**Range:** Summoned to caster's presence

An [invisible stalker](#invisible_stalker) is summoned to the caster's presence and magically bound to perform a mission of the caster's choosing.

- The caster must be careful with the wording of the mission. Invisible stalkers are treacherous and, unless the assigned mission can be easily and quickly accomplished, will follow the letter of the command while twisting the intent.
- The creature is bound to attempt the mission until it succeeds or is destroyed.
- The spell [_dispel evil_](#dispel_evil) will banish an invisible stalker, ending the spell.

### [Lower Water](name:lower_water)

**Duration:** 10 turns  
**Range:** 240'

This spell reduces the depth of a body of water by half for the duration. An area of up to 10,000 square feet may be affected.

### [Move Earth](name:move_earth)

**Duration:** 6 turns  
**Range:** 240'

Earth (but not stone) within range is rearranged as the caster wishes.

- The range of the spell also extends downwards, allowing excavations to be made.
- The caster can move earth in the area at up to 60' per turn.

### [Part Water](name:part_water)

**Duration:** 6 turns  
**Range:** 120'

The caster creates a path 10' wide and a maximum of 120' long through water, such as a pond, lake, or other body. The caster can dismiss the spell's effect before the duration ends.

### [Projected Image](name:projected_image)

**Duration:** 6 turns  
**Range:** 240'

An illusory duplicate of the caster appears within range.

- The image is an exact duplicate of the caster that can only be differentiated by touch.
- Subsequent spells cast appear to originate from the image. (Targets must still be visible to the caster, however.)
- The image appears unaffected by spells or missile weapons.
- If the image is touched or hit in melee, it disappears.

### [Reincarnation](name:reincarnation)

**Duration:** Permanent  
**Range:** Appears in the caster's presence

A dead character is returned to life in a new physical form that manifests in the presence of the caster. The character's new body is not necessarily the same as the original; it is determined by rolling on the topmost table below.

The roll indicates either a character class or a monster:

- ***Character class:*** The character is of experience level 1d6 (or at most the same level as the character achieved before death). The reincarnated character can continue to gain experience and advance as normal, in the new class.
- ***Monster:*** The type should be determined by the referee. The monster should be at least partially intelligent, have no greater Hit Dice than the level of the character being reincarnated (at most 6 HD), and be of the same alignment. The tables below may be used or the referee may create his or her own tables. Monsters cannot gain experience or advance in level.

The descriptions and stats of the monsters listed in the standard tables given here can be found in [***Monsters***](#monsters).

### [Stone to Flesh](name:stone_to_flesh)

**Duration:** Permanent  
**Range:** 120'

This spell transforms stone into living flesh. It is especially useful for restoring life to a petrified creature and its equipment to its normal state.

[**Reversed: Flesh to Stone**](name:flesh_to_stone)

Turns one creature into a statue, including all gear and any items currently held. A **saving throw versus paralysis** is permitted to resist the transformation.

# [Sequence of Play](name:sequence_of_play)

## [One Dungeon Turn](name:turn)

1. The referee checks for [***Wandering Monsters***](#wandering_monsters), if applicable.
2. The party decides what action to take (e.g. moving, searching, listening, entering rooms).
3. The referee describes what happens.
4. If no encounter occurs, the turn is over, continue to step 5. If monsters are encountered, first follow the encounter sequence, below.
5. The turn ends. The referee should update time records, with special attention to light sources, spell durations, and the party's need to rest.

## [One Wilderness Day](name:day)

1. The players decide on their course of travel for the day.
2. The referee determines whether the party gets lost (see [***Losing Direction***](#losing_direction)).
3. The referee checks for [***Wandering Monsters***](#wandering_monsters), if applicable.
4. The referee describes the terrain passed through and any sites of interest that the party comes across, asking players for their actions, as required.
5. If no encounters occur, the day is over, continue to step 6. If monsters are encountered, first follow the encounter sequence, below.
6. The day ends. The referee should update time records, with special attention to rations, spell durations, and the party's need to rest.

## [Encounter Sequence](name:encounter_sequence)

1. The referee rolls for surprise, if applicable, and determines how far away the monsters are.
2. Any sides that are not surprised roll initiative (see [***Basic Combat Procedure***](#basic_combat_procedure)) to determine who acts first.
3. The referee determines the monsters' reaction to the party. The players decide how they will act:
    1. If both sides wish to talk, the negotiation may be role-played. The referee may make reaction rolls, as applicable.
    2. If the players decide to flee, the referee determines whether the monsters pursue.
    3. If combat breaks out, follow the steps listed in [***Basic Combat Procedure***](#basic_combat_procedure).

See [***Encounters***](#encounters) for a full description on all elements of running an encounter, including encounter distance, surprise, and monster reactions.

# [Combat](name:basic_combat_procedure)

## [Sequence of Events](name:sequence_of_events)

The sequence of actions in each round is broken down as follows:

1. Characters who wish to cast a spell or perform a full retreat from melee must declare it.
2. Initiative: 1d6 is rolled by each opposing side.
3. The winner of initiative acts first:
    1. The referee may check [***Morale***](#morale) for monsters.
    2. Movements are made.
    3. Missile attacks are made, accounting for DEX modifiers, cover, range, and magic adjustments.
    4. Spells are cast and applicable saving throws are made.
    5. Melee combat and other actions occur; attacks are made, accounting for STR modifiers and magic adjustments.
4. Other sides act through step 3, in order of initiative.
5. When all sides of a conflict have acted, the round is over. If the combat has not come to an end, the sequence begins again at step 1.

## [Initiative](name:initiative)

At the start of each round, each side rolls 1d6 to determine initiative. The side with the highest result on 1d6 acts first for that round. Other sides in a conflict will react in order from highest to lowest roll.

### [Tied Initiative](name:tied_initiative)

If initiative is a tie, each side in the tie acts at the same time. All actions are completed, unaffected by opposed actions. For example, two opponents in melee may both inflict enough damage to kill the other. As the initiative is tied, both attacks occur simultaneously, resulting in both characters being killed.

### [Two-Handed Weapons](name:two_handed_weapons)

Characters wielding two-handed melee weapons (and some missile weapons--as indicated in the equipment description) always act last in the round, as if they had lost initiative.

### [Individual Initiative (Optional Rule)](name:individual_initiative)

Instead of an initiative roll per side, a roll may be made for each individual PC or monster involved in a battle, modified by DEX. The referee may determine an initiative bonus or penalty for monsters which are very fast or slow, instead of applying a DEX modifier.

## [Movement in Combat](name:movement_in_combat)

### [With Another Action](name:with_another_action)

A character can move up to one third of his or her normal movement rate every round and can also attack (if an enemy is within that distance) or perform another action (except spell casting) during a round.

### [Without Another Action](name:without_another_action)

A character who performs no other action in a round may run, moving up to his or her full movement rate.

### [Retreating From Melee](name:retreating_from_melee)

When in melee with a foe, free movement is not so simple. Breaking away from melee is possible in two ways, as follows.

A **fighting retreat** allows a character to move backwards at up to half his or her encounter movement rate (i.e. one sixth of his or her base movement rate). However, there must be a clear path for this movement.

A **full retreat** occurs when a character moves backwards at a rate faster than half of his or her encounter movement rate. The character making the movement forfeits attacking this round and the opponent gains a +2 bonus to all attacks against the character this round. In addition, if the retreating character is carrying a shield, it does not apply to the character's Armour Class during the retreat.

## [Actions in One Round](name:actions_in_one_round)

Characters can generally move and perform one action in a round. The most common actions are attacking, casting a spell, or using an item that is easily to hand, but many other actions are possible and must be adjudicated by the referee. The referee has the final say on what can or cannot be done in one round. Note that, when casting a spell, the character may not move as well.

## [Attacking](name:attacking)

A character may attack if there is an enemy within striking range. Player characters can normally only attack once per round, but some monsters have multiple attacks.

## [Range For Melee vs Missile Attacks](name:range_for_melee_vs_missile_attacks)

Melee attacks are possible when opponents are 5' or less from each other. Missile attacks are possible when opponents are more than 5' from one another.

## [Attack Rolls](name:attack_rolls)

The player or referee rolls 1d20, modified by STR for melee attacks or DEX for missile attacks. The result is compared to the appropriate attack table (see Standard Combat Charts, p26). A result that is equal to or above the attack value corresponding to the attacker's level or Hit Dice and the opponent's Armour Class results in a hit.

### [Natural 1s and 20s](name:natural_1s_and_20s)

- An attack roll of 20 always hits, unless the target cannot be harmed by the attack (e.g. a normal weapon used against a foe which can only be harmed by magic).
- An attack roll of 1 is always a miss.

### [Damage Rolls](name:damage_rolls)

Upon a successful attack, damage is inflicted, taking into account any bonuses or penalties. Player character attacks inflict 1d6 damage; monster attacks deal the damage indicated in the monster's description.

An attack which hits always deals at least one point of damage, even when damage modifiers reduce the number rolled to 0 or less.

A character or monster reduced to 0 hit points or less is killed.

### [Variable Weapon Damage (Optional Rule)](name:variable_weapon_damage)

Some groups may prefer different weapons to inflict different amounts of damage. In this case, rather than rolling a flat 1d6 for all PC attacks, the die type indicated for the weapon in the equipment lists should be rolled.

## [Missile Weapon Ranges](name:missile_weapon_ranges)

All missile weapons have ranges, which must be taken into account when trying to strike an opponent at a distance:

- If an opponent is within the distance listed for **short range**, the attacker gets a +1 to hit.
- There are no bonuses or penalties for striking an opponent at **medium range**.
- There is a penalty of &minus;1 to strike an opponent at **long range**.
- If an opponent is further away than the long range listed, the missile weapon cannot hit that opponent.

## [Casting a Spell](name:casting_a_spell)

### [Requirements](name:requirements)

1. The caster must be able to speak and to move his or her hands, in order to bring a magic effect into being. As a result, a spell caster cannot cast spells if gagged, bound, or in an area of magical silence.
2. Spell casters may take no other actions (including movement!) during the same round they intend to cast a spell.
3. Unless otherwise noted in a spell's description, a spell caster must have the intended target (a specific monster, character, or area of effect) within visual range.

### [Disrupting Spells](name:disrupting_spells)

If a spell caster loses initiative and is successfully attacked or fails a saving throw before his or her turn, the spell being cast is disrupted and fails. The spell is removed from the caster's memory as if it had been cast.

## [Attacking from Behind](name:attacking_from_behind)

Attacks made on a character from behind ignore the influence of the attacked character's shield, if any.

## [Boarding Vessels](name:boarding_vessels)

When the occupants of a vessel wish to board another vessel, there is a 2-in-6 chance of being able to successfully manoeuvre the vessel into a boarding position and clamp onto the other vessel with grappling hooks. If the occupants of both vessels wish to board one another, their mutual intent makes the action succeed with no chance of failure. Once crew-members come into contact with one another, combat ensues following the standard combat rules. Characters who are in the act of boarding another vessel suffer a penalty of &minus;2 to attack rolls and Armour Class for one round.

## [Cover](name:cover)

Cover is an important factor that can influence missile attacks. An attacker cannot hit an opponent that is entirely behind a barrier. If the target is only partly behind cover, the referee may apply attack penalties of between &minus;1 and &minus;4. For example, if a character were attempting to strike an opponent through a small window, the referee might call for a penalty of &minus;4. If the opponent were only partly covered, such as by small furniture, the penalty might only be &minus;1.

## [Helpless Opponents](name:helpless_opponents)

Helpless opponents, such as those sleeping, bound, magically frozen, etc., are automatically hit by any melee attacks in combat. Only a roll for damage is required.

## [Magical Monsters](name:magical_monsters)

Some monsters may only be damaged by magical or silver weapons. The referee may, optionally, allow such monsters to also be harmed by attacks from:

- Another such monster.
- A monster with 5 HD or greater.

## [Morale (Optional Rule)](name:morale)

Players may always decide whether they will fight, surrender, or run away in an encounter. The referee decides whether monsters or NPCs surrender or run away.

Monsters have a listing for morale, rated from 2 to 12, which represents how likely they are to fight or flee when in an encounter. A score of 2 means the monster never fights (unless absolutely cornered) and a score of 12 means the monster will fight until killed, with no morale check necessary in either case.

### [Morale Checks](name:morale_checks)

The referee rolls 2d6 and, if the roll is higher than the morale of the monster, the check is a failure and the monster will either surrender or attempt a full retreat or a fighting retreat. If the result is equal to or lower than the morale score, a monster will continue to fight.

### [When to Check Morale](name:when_to_check_morale)

The referee usually makes a morale checkfor monsters under two conditions:

1. When one side of the encounter first loses a member due to death.
2. When half the monsters are either killed or otherwise incapacitated.

If a monster makes two successful morale checks in an encounter, it will fight until killed.

### [Adjustments to Morale](name:adjustments_to_morale)

The referee may decide to apply bonuses or penalties to morale, with a range of &minus;2 to +2, depending on the circumstances. For example, if one side of an encounter is losing or winning, they might receive a penalty or bonus to morale of &minus;1 or +1, respectively.

Adjustments are never applied to monsters with a morale of 2 or 12.

### [Retainer Morale](name:check_retainer_morale)

Retainers signed up to work as adventurers, so are not frightened off at the first sign of danger. They only check morale in combat when confronted with extraordinary danger. See [***Retainer Morale***](#retainer_morale) for details.

## [Multiple Attackers](name:multiple_attackers)

The referee should use discretion in determining how many attackers can strike at one opponent. Usually only two characters may fight side-by-side in a 10' wide hallway, unless all of the attackers are small.

## [Non-Lethal Combat](name:non_lethal_combat)

Any characters that wish to subdue an opponent must announce that they are attacking without intent to kill. All hand weapons with a blade may be employed to deal blunt blows with the flat of the blade.

Combat and damage are calculated normally, noting how much damage is non-lethal, "subdual" damage. A character or monster that reaches 0 hit points due to subdual damage is knocked unconscious.

Monsters may only be subdued in this way at the referee's discretion.

## [Unarmed Attacks](name:unarmed_attacks)

Unarmed combat is the same as melee combat, but all damage is 1 to 2 + STR modifiers.

## [Unstable Surfaces](name:unstable_surfaces)

Characters on an unstable surface, such as a ship in rough seas or riding a flying animal such as a griffon, are affected as follows:

- Spells cannot be cast because the intricate hand gestures are not possible in that shaky environment.
- Missile attacks suffer a penalty of &minus;4 to hit.
- Magic items do not require the same concentration and gestures, and can be used as normal.

Note that magical means of flight (e.g. a magic broom, carpet, or the fly spell) generally provide a smooth ride and do not count as unstable.

## [Water](name:water)

Characters fighting in or beneath water should have a penalty applied to their attack rolls. Damage from successful hits should also be reduced. Most missile weapons do not work underwater.

# [Adventuring Rules](name:adventuring_rules)

## [Ability Checks (Optional Rule)](name:ability_checks)

Sometimes, the referee might require a test against an ability score, instead of a saving throw, to determine if a character succeeds in a task or escapes a danger. For example, DEX might be used to jump over a pit or STR might be used to push an object.

The player rolls 1d20 and, if the result is less than or equal to the ability, the check succeeds. If the roll is greater than the ability, the check fails.

Bonuses or penalties to the roll may be applied, with a modifier of &minus;4 being a relatively easy ability check and +4 being very difficult. Of course, any modifier between these extremes can be applied.

An unmodified roll of 1 should be treated as a success and a 20 treated as a failure.

## [Castles and Strongholds](name:castles_and_strongholds)

### [Planning and Construction](name:planning_and_construction)

The construction of a castle or stronghold has the following steps:

1. ***Permission:*** It is sometimes necessary to secure permission to build from an existing authority over the land. This may not be required if the land is wilderness and is uncharted.
2. ***Clear land:*** All monsters in the local area (one hex on a small-scale wilderness map---typically 6 miles across) must be killed or driven off.
3. ***Design:*** The player must create a plan for the stronghold and calculate the costs based on the price suggestions listed in this section. The plan should take account of the required thickness of the walls (see the dimensions of different structures, opposite).
4. ***Review:*** The referee should review and approve the player's plans.
5. ***Hire engineers:*** In addition to normal building costs, the character must hire at least one engineer per 100,000 gp cost of the stronghold.
6. ***Construction:*** Once the land has been cleared and construction materials delivered, construction may commence. The time required depends entirely on the stronghold's total price: one day of game time per 500 gp.
7. ***Prepare for settlers:*** When construction is complete, the character may wish to clear any monsters out of adjacent hexes, so as to provide a safe area for settlers.

### [Building in Towns](name:building_in_towns)

If a character has permission to build in an existing town or city, the costs are greatly reduced due to the proximity of materials and labour. Stone buildings cost 40% of the listed price and wooden buildings 20%. It is unlikely that the local ruler will grant permission for the construction of castles or fortifications by player characters in a town.

### [Maintaining Cleared Lands](name:maintaining_cleared_lands)

In order to prevent monsters from returning to cleared lands, mercenaries may be hired to conduct patrols. These patrols can cover a maximum of an 18-mile radius around a stronghold (6 miles, in inhospitable terrain such as swamp, mountains, or thick jungle). If the area to be maintained is larger than this radius, additional garrisons must be stationed at intervals.

### [Settlers and Taxation](name:settlers_and_taxation)

The character may wish to attract settlers into a cleared area. In addition to ensuring the safety of surrounding lands, the character will have to fund construction of other buildings (e.g. mills, inns, docks, etc.) to attract settlers. Advertising may also be necessary. The referee will determine the costs involved and how many settlers are attracted.

The character can expect to gain money through taxes at a rate of 10 gp per settler per year. These taxes can be used to pay patrolling mercenaries or to further invest in infrastructure that encourages commerce.

### [Standard Structures](name:standard_structures)

Structure | Description | Dimensions | Cost
----------|-------------|------------|-----
Barbican | Heavily fortified entry/exit point in a castle wall. Consists of two small towers, a gatehouse, and a drawbridge. | See small tower, gatehouse, drawbridge | 37,000gp
Bastion | Semi-circular tower built against a castle wall. | 30' base, 30' high, walls 5' thick | 9,000gp
Civilian building, stone | Two levels; wooden stairs, doors, floors, and roof; attic. | Outer wall 120' long (e.g. 30'&times;40'), walls 1--2' thick | 3,000gp
Civilian building, wood | Two levels; wooden stairs, doors, floors, and roof; attic. | Outer wall 120' long (e.g. 30'&times;40') | 1,500gp
Drawbridge | Raisable wooden bridge crossing a moat. May be attached to a gatehouse. | 10' long | 500gp
Gatehouse | Fortified entry/exit point in a castle wall. Includes a portcullis. | 30'&times;20' base, 20' high, walls 5' thick | 6,500gp
Keep | Square, fortified building at the centre of a castle. | 60' base, 80' high, walls 10' thick | 75,000gp
Moat | Defensive ditch, optionally filled with water. | 100' long, 20' wide, 10' deep | 400gp
Subterranean passage | Typical dungeon passageway. | 10'&times;10'&times;10' | 500gp
Tower, large | Round tower, either freestanding or built into a castle wall. | 30' base, 40' high, walls 5' thick | 30,000gp
Tower, small | Round tower, either freestanding or built into a castle wall. | 20' base, 30' high, walls 5' thick | 15,000gp
Wall, castle | Stone wall with battlements. | 100' long, 20' high, 10' thick | 5,000gp

#### [Non-Standard Dimensions](name:non_standard_dimensions)

***Bastion:*** Bastions of different dimensions to those listed above may be constructed. Use the guidelines for tower pricing, below, and divide by two.

***Tower:*** Towers of different dimensions to those listed above may be constructed. The cost is determined as follows:

- The diameter of a tower's base determines the cost per 10' of height and the maximum height (twice the base diameter).
- Up to the base diameter, each 10' of height costs 200 gp &times; the base diameter in feet.
- Above the base diameter, each 10' of height costs 400 gp &times; the base diameter in feet.

>**Example Tower Cost Calculation**
>
>A 60' high tower with a 40' diameter base is to be constructed.
>
>The cost will be 8,000 gp (40 &times; 200 gp) per 10' for the first 40' of height and 16,000 gp (40 &times; 400 gp) per 10' for the remainder of the height.
>
>The total cost is thus (8,000 gp &times; 4) + (16,000 gp &times; 2) = 64,000 gp.

***Wall, castle:*** Higher castle walls may be constructed at increased cost. A 100' length of 30' high wall costs 7,500 gp. Every additional 10' of height beyond this (up to a maximum of 60' high) costs 5,000 gp.

### [Interior Details](name:interior_details)

For simplicity, the cost of a stronghold may be increased by 25% to account for interior details, including: reinforced doors, stone stairs, flagstone flooring, tile roofing, windows or arrow slits, bars and shutters on windows, and standard furnishings.

If the group wishes to perform more detailed calculations or if additional features are desired, the chart below may be consulted.

Detail | Dimensions | Cost
-----------|---|-----
Arrow slit | -- | 10gp
Door, iron | 3' wide, 7' tall | 50gp
Door, reinforced wood | 3' wide, 7' tall | 20gp
Door, stone | 3' wide, 7' tall | 50gp
Door, wood | 3' wide, 7' tall | 10gp
Floor, flagstones or tiles | 10'&times;10' section | 100gp

Trapdoor, reinforced wood | 4'&times;3' | 40gp
Trapdoor, stone | 4'&times;3' | 120gp
Trapdoor, wood | 4'&times;3' | 20gp
Window | -- | 10gp
Window bars | -- | 10gp
Window shutters | -- | 5gp

## [Chases](name:chases)

When the party encounters monsters and one side decides to flee, the other may wish to pursue them. Generally, this is possible in two situations:

- Combat has not commenced.
- One side breaks away from combat.

(See [***Encounters***](#encounters) for details.)

### [Surprise](name:chase_surprise)

If one side is surprised, the other side may be able to flee without the possibility of being chased--the surprised side may not even be aware that the encounter occurred. In the wilderness, where greater distances are involved, this is always possible.

### [Group Movement Rate](name:group_movement_rate)

It is common for monsters to chase the whole party, as a group. In this case, it is important to note that a side's movement rate is usually determined by the speed of the slowest member.

### [Chases in the Dungeon](name:chases_in_the_dungeon)

One side can always successfully flee if its movement rate (see [***Movement***](#movement)) is higher than the other side's and if combat has not commenced. A pursuit is possible if the pursuing side's movement rate is greater than or equal to the fleeing side's.

Time in a chase is measured in rounds (see [***Time***](#time)). Most monsters will not continue a chase if the characters manage to get out of the monster's range of vision.

If the monsters enjoy treasure, there is a 3-in-6 probability that they will stop pursuit to collect any treasure the characters drop. Hungry or less intelligent monsters may do the same if the characters drop food. Burning oil or other obstacles may also slow or stop a pursuit.

### [Chases in the Wilderness](name:chases_in_the_wilderness)

With the open spaces and (generally) good visibility in the wilderness, a chase is assumed to play out over an extended period--time is not tracked round by round. The probability that one group can escape from another is determined by the relative size of the two sides. The more members in the pursuing side there are relative to the fleeing side, the greater chances the fleeing side has of escaping. This is because larger groups cannot move as fast or as quietly.

The basic chance of escape is determined by consulting the table opposite. The referee may modify the probabilities based on the conditions and environment. For example, if one side has time to flee within a densely wooded area, the referee may give a bonus of 25% to escape. If one side's movement rate is double that of the other, the chance to escape may be modified by 25% in its favour. There is always at least a 5% chance of escape, except when surprise is involved.

The following procedure is followed, day by day, until the chase is over:

1. Roll for escape (see table, below). If the roll succeeds, the fleeing party has escaped; the chase is over.
2. If the roll fails, the fleeing party must choose either to be caught (ending the chase) or to flee in a random direction, determined by the referee (no mapping is possible).
3. If the chase continues, compare the speeds of the fleeing and pursuing sides:
    1. If the fleeing side is at least as fast as the pursuing side, it has another chance to escape; return to step 1.
    2. If the pursuing side is faster, there is a 50% chance of them catching up. If the roll succeeds, the fleeing side has been caught; the chase is over. If the roll fails, the fleeing party has another chance to escape; return to step 1.

Fleeing group size | 10% | 25% | 35% | 50% | 70% | 90%
---|---|---|---|---|---|---
1--4 | -- | -- | -- | 1 pursuer | 2--3 pursuers | 4+ pursuers
5--12 | -- | -- | 1--3 pursuers | 4--8 pursuers | 9+ pursuers | --
13--24 | -- | 1--6 pursuers | 7--16 pursuers | 17+ pursuers | -- | --
25+ | 1--10 pursuers | 11--30 pursuers | 31+ pursuers | -- | -- | --

### [Waterborne Chases](name:waterborne_chases)

When two waterborne sides (ships or swimming monsters) encounter one another, one side may choose to flee.

First, the initial distance between each side is determined as normal for an encounter. Next, the fleeing party rolls on the chart below. Success depends on luck and the difference between the two groups' movement rates.

If the roll to escape succeeds, the pursuers cannot attempt to catch up with the fleeing side until the next day--and then only if a random encounter roll indicates an encounter.

If the roll to escape fails, the distance between the two sides will decrease by the pursuer's movement rate each round (or a minimum of 30' per round, if the pursuer has a slower movement rate than the fleeing side).

Fleeing Side's Movement Rate | Chance of Escape
---|---
Faster than pursuer | 80%
Equal movement rate or up to 30' per round slower than pursuer | 50%
Up to 60' per round slower than pursuer | 40%
Up to 90' per round slower than pursuer | 35%
Up to 120' per round slower than pursuer | 25%
More than 120' per round slower than pursuer | 10%

## [Climbing](name:climbing)

When characters are climbing in a difficult or tense situation, the referee may specify a chance of failure (as a percentage or an x-in-6 chance) or may require an ability check versus DEX (if the optional [***Ability Checks***](#ability_checks) rule is being used).

Note that very steep or sheer surfaces are normally impossible to climb without specialised equipment. Some characters may have class abilities which allow them to attempt to climb such surfaces unaided.

## [Distance and Measurement](name:distance_and_measurement)

When characters are adventuring in a dungeon, all ranges and movement rates are measured in feet. However, the wilderness is not cramped like a dungeon and characters can usually see further ahead and need not be as wary of obstacles. For this reason, ranges and movement rates are measured in yards, rather than feet, in the wilderness.

Note that areas (such as the area of a spell effect or a breath weapon) are always measured in feet, both in dungeons and in the wilderness.

## [Doors](name:doors)

Dungeons often have many doors, some secret and others obvious. Many are locked and many are stuck.

### [Locked Doors](name:locked_doors)

Locks must be picked by a character proficient with lock picks or opened by magic.

### [Stuck Doors](name:stuck_doors)

There is a base 2-in-6 chance of being able to force open a stuck door. Strength adjustments apply, but cannot take the success range above 5-in-6 or below 1-in-6.

A failed attempt to force open a door eliminates any possibility of surprise (see Encounters, p11) that the party may have against any monsters on the other side of the door.

Note that monsters resident to the dungeon are often able to pass through stuck doors unhindered.

### [Secret Doors](name:secret_doors)

Secret doors can only be spotted if characters are specifically looking for them. See [***Searching***](#searching).

### [Wedging Doors](name:wedging_doors)

Doors opened by adventurers (by whatever means) are likely to swing shut after they pass. To prevent this, doors may be held open using iron spikes or other wedges.

Likewise, players may wish to wedge doors shut, to hinder monsters' movement.

### [Listening at Doors](name:listening_at_doors)

PCs have a 1-in-6 chance of detecting subtle sounds beyond a door. (Some types of adventurer may have an increased chance of success.)

The referee should always roll for the character listening so that the player never knows if the roll failed or if there simply is no sound behind the door.

This attempt may only be made one time at any door by a character. Note that some creatures, such as undead, do not make any noise.

## [Encounters](name:encounters)

An encounter begins when the characters stumble onto a monster, either because the referee has planned an encounter in the area the PCs are exploring or because a random die roll indicates an encounter (see [***Wandering Monsters***](#wandering_monsters)).

### [Time in Encounters](name:time_in_encounters)

When an encounter begins, action is measured in rounds (see [***Time***](#time)) determine which side acts first.

### [Surprise](name:surprise)

Checks for surprise are made whenever an encounter is unexpected by at least one side. For instance, if the player characters are making a lot of noise, a monster may not have a chance to be surprised, but the characters might be, if the monster was waiting quietly.

Each side that is not already aware of the other's presence rolls 1d6. The referee rolls for monsters and one player rolls for the adventuring party as a whole. A result of 1 or 2 means the side is surprised and cannot act for one round. If both sides are surprised, there is simply a momentary confusion--neither side has any advantage. If one side is surprised but the other is not, then the side that is not surprised gains a one round advantage.

Note that aquatic monsters are usually not surprised by ships. Special circumstances (e.g. thick fog) may alter this.

### [Encounter Distance](name:encounter_distance)

The situation in which the encounter occurs often determines how far away the monster is. If there is uncertainty (for example, in the case of [***Wandering Monsters***](#wandering_monsters)):

- **In a dungeon**, the monster encountered is 2d6 &times; 10 feet away, moving in the direction of the party.
- **In the wilderness**, the monster is 4d6 &times; 10 yards away. If either side is surprised, this is reduced to 1d4 &times; 10 yards.
- **At sea**, monsters are encountered at the same distance as in the wilderness (see above). Ships may be sighted and identified at 300 yards on a clear day or as little as 40 yards in dense fog.

### [Monster Reactions](name:monster_reactions)

Very often, circumstances make it obvious how a monster will react when encountered. However, sometimes the referee may wish to roll on the table below to determine how a monster reacts to encountering the party. If one specific character attempts to interact with monsters, that character's CHA score is used to modify the reaction roll.

2d6 | Result
---|---
2 or less | Hostile, attacks
3--5 | Unfriendly, may attack
6--8 | Neutral, uncertain
9--11 | Indifferent, uninterested
12 or more | Friendly, helpful

### [Evasion](name:evasion)

The characters may decide they are outmatched and flee an encounter or a monster might flee. Characters may choose whether they chase a fleeing monster. The referee will decide if monsters chase fleeing characters. A low roll on the [***Monster Reactions***](#monster_reactions) for complete rules on handling pursuit.

### [Encounter Duration](name:encounter_duration)

An encounter is assumed to take at least one full turn to complete, including time to rest,regroup, clean weapons, bind wounds, and so on, afterwards.

## [Encumbrance (Optional Rule)](name:encumbrance)

>Author's note: The original Basic rules contain ambiguities relating to the encumbrance system. I have attempted to resolve these ambiguities in a sensible and consistent way, but other interpretations of the original rules are possible.

It is important to keep track of how much player characters are carrying, becausethis affects how much treasure they can haul from a dungeon. Groups who wish different characters to have different movement rates (see [***Movement***](#movement)), based on the amount of equipment or treasure they are carrying may use one of the following rules. The same rule should be applied to all characters.

As coins are the most common form of treasure found by adventurers, both encumbrance systems are based on weight measured in coins. Ten coins are equivalent to one pound.

**Treasure Encumbrance in Coins**

Treasure | Weight in Coins
---|---
Coin (any type) | 1
Gem | 1
Jewellery (1 piece) | 10
Potion | 10
Rod | 20
Scroll | 1
Staff | 40
Wand | 10

### [Option 1: Encumbrance by Armour Type](name:encumbrance_by_armor)

This rule may be used by groups who want a simple system for determining the movement rates of different characters.

A character's movement rate is determined by two factors: the armour he or she is wearing and whether he or she is carrying a significant amount of treasure or not (at the referee's discretion).

The maximum amount of treasure any character can carry is 1,600 coins or equivalent. For this reason, the weight of treasure carried must be tracked. The encumbrance of common types of treasure is shown in the table above. The weight of the character's standard adventuring gear (including armour and weapons) is _not_ counted.

Armour | Without Treasure | Carrying Treasure
---|---|---
Unarmoured | 120' | 90'
Leather armour | 90' | 60'
Metal armour | 60' | 30'

### [Option 2: Encumbrance by Weight Carried](name:encumbrance_by_weight)

This rule may be used by groups who want to make sure characters carry more realistic amounts of equipment and treasure.

A character's encumbrance value is calculated based on adding the weights of all significant items carried, including treasure (see table above), weapons, and armour (see tables below). The character's movement rate is then based on the total encumbrance value. Miscellaneous adventuring gear (backpack, spikes, sacks, etc.) may be counted as 80 coins of weight.

The maximum any character can carry is 1,600 coins.

Encumbrance | Movement Rate
---|---
Up to 400 coins | 120'
Up to 600 coins | 90'
Up to 800 coins | 60'
Up to 1,600 coins | 30'

### [Equipment Encumbrance in Coins](name:equipment_encumbrance)

(Only used with encumbrance option 2.)

Armour | Weight in Coins
---|---
Leather armour | 200
Chain mail | 400
Plate mail | 500
Shield | 100

Weapon | Weight in Coins
---|---
Battle axe | 50
Bow + 20 arrows | 30
Club | 50
Crossbow + 30 quarrels | 50
Dagger | 10
Hand axe | 30
Long sword | 60
Mace | 30
Polearm | 150
Short sword | 30
Spear | 30
Two-handed sword | 150
Warhammer | 30

## [Experience Points](name:experience_points)

All characters that make it through an adventure alive receive experience points (XP). XP is gained from two sources: treasure recovered and monsters defeated.

### [Recovered Treasure](name:recovered_treasure)

Characters gain XP from treasure at the rate of 1 XP per 1 gold piece (gp) value of the item. The values of all items are added together and converted to gold piece units. Only treasure of a non-magical nature grants XP in this way.

### [Defeated Monsters](name:defeated_monsters)

All monsters defeated by the party (slain, outsmarted, captured, scared away, etc.) grant XP based on how powerful they are. The XP value of a monster is determined by its Hit Dice plus a bonus for each special ability it has (e.g. breath attacks, spell-like abilities, etc.). See the chart below. A monster defeated under especially dangerous circumstances may be treated as one Hit Dice category higher on the chart.

Monster HD | Base XP | Bonus XP / Ability
---|---|---
Less than 1 | 5 | 1
1 | 10 | 3
1+ | 15 | 4
2 | 20 | 5
2+ | 25 | 10
3 | 35 | 15
3+ | 50 | 25
4 | 75 | 50
4+ | 125 | 75
5 | 175 | 125
5+ | 225 | 175
6 | 275 | 225
6+ | 350 | 300
7 | 450 | 400
8 | 650 | 550
9--10+ | 900 | 700
11--12+ | 1,100 | 800
13--16+ | 1,350 | 950
17--20+ | 2,000 | 1,150
21+* | 2,500 | 2,000

\* _For monsters of HD 22 and higher, add a cumulative 250 XP for the Base and Bonus categories._

### [Division of Experience](name:divison_of_experience)

The XP awards for treasures recovered and monsters defeated are totalled and divided evenly between all characters who survived the adventure. Note that total XP is divided evenly between all party members (including [***Retainers***](#retainers)), irrespective of how the players decide to divide the treasure.

### [Discretionary Bonuses and Penalties](name:discretionary_bonuses_and_penalties)

The referee may grant XP bonuses to players who did particularly well. Likewise, players who did not do their share of the work in an adventure may be penalized.

### [Prime Requisite Modifiers](name:prime_requisite_modifiers)

In addition, characters receive XP bonuses or penalties based on their score in their class prime requisites, as described in [***Ability Scores***](#ability_scores).

All bonuses or penalties to experience are applied to the grand total XP a particular character receives at the end of an adventure.

### [Maximum XP in One Session](name:maximum_xp_in_one_session)

Characters should not be given enough experience to advance two or more levels in one adventure. Any additional points that would take a character to a level two above his or her current level are lost.

## [Falling](name:falling)

Falling from a height onto a hard surface inflicts 1d6 damage per 10' fallen.

## [Foraging and Hunting](name:foraging_and_hunting)

When adventuring in a dungeon, there may be very little available to eat. Characters must take rations with them to cover the extent of time they expect to be away from town. However, they may occasionally kill an edible monster. When in the wilderness, characters can hunt or forage for food.

### [Foraging](name:foraging)

Foraging for food is an activity that can be accomplished without hindering travel speed by gathering fruit, herbs, nuts, or small animals along the way. For each day of travel while foraging, characters have a 1-in-6 chance of acquiring sufficient food for 1d6 human-sized beings.

### [Hunting](name:hunting)

Hunting must be engaged in as the sole activity for a day--no travelling or resting is possible. When hunting, there is a 1-in-6 chance of encountering animals which may be suitable for eating (if they can be caught!). This is in addition to the normal chance of random encounters (see [***Wandering Monsters***](#wandering_monsters)).

## [Healing](name:healing)

For each full day of complete rest, a character or monster recovers 1d3 hit points. If the rest is interrupted, the character or monster will not heal that day.

Healing may also occur through magic, such as potions or spells. This kind of healing is instantaneous. Magical healing and natural healing can be combined.

## [Hirelings](name:hirelings)

Hirelings are NPCs hired by a character to perform certain services. Hirelings differ from [***Retainers***](#retainers) in that they do not accompany characters on adventures. For this reason, they do not count toward a character's maximum number of retainers, since they are not the same kind of hired help.

The most common types of hireling are:

- ***Mercenaries:*** Hired soldiers who will guard, patrol, and otherwise serve in wilderness settings, but only as part of a larger force, not an adventuring party.
- ***Specialists:*** Hired individuals who have a particular trade or who have special knowledge. These individuals are usually hired for a specific task.

Like hiring retainers, mercenaries and specialists can be located by frequenting pubs or through posting notices of help wanted. Also, in the case of professional specialists, these individuals may have shops or a reputation that the characters can follow. There may also be guilds of certain professions which can act as a contact point for locating specialists.

Some of the most common kinds of hirelings that can be found are described [***Hirelings***](#hirelings).

## [Light, Vision, and Visibility](name:light_vision_and_visibility)

### [In the Dungeon](name:vision_in_the_dungeon)

Characters will usually want to bring a source of light with them on underground expeditions. Typical light sources enable normal vision within a 30' radius.

The adventuring equipment lists  in [***Equipment***](#equipment) provide full information.

### [In the Wilderness](name:vision_in_the_wilderness)

Characters can usually see for three miles around them, in open terrain. This range may sometimes be reduced (e.g. in overgrown terrain such as a forest) or increased (e.g. looking out from the top of a mountain).

### [At Sea](name:vision_at_sea)

On a clear day, land can be spotted at a distance of 24 miles. This may be reduced based on light and weather conditions.

### [Light and Surprise](name:light_and_surprise)

Characters or monsters that carry a light in a dark environment are usually unable to surprise opponents (see [***Encounters***](#encounters)), because the light gives them away.

### [Infravision](name:wilderness_infravision)

All non-human monsters and many demi-human races have infravision. Characters who have infravision can see the heat energy that radiates off of living things. Generally, living things will be visible as bright tones, while cool items are grey and very cold objects are black. It is not possible to read in the dark with infravision, because fine detail cannot be perceived.

Infravision works within a limited range (60' for monsters) and only functions in darkness. Visible light (normal or magical) and large heat sources will disrupt it.

## [Losing Direction](name:losing_direction)

### [At Sea](name:lost_at_sea)

Getting lost at sea is a serious risk. When in sight of land, the chance of getting lost is 2-in-6. Once out of sight of land, the chance of getting lost is 100%, unless a navigator is aboard--the chance of getting lost is then 2-in-6 per day.

### [In the Wilderness](name:lost_in_the_wilderness)

Characters can confidently follow trails, roads, and other well-known landmarks without fear of becoming lost. However, when travelling through untracked wilderness, it is easy to lose direction. At the start of each day of travel, the referee will roll to determine if the group loses direction. The probability depends on the terrain being traversed:

- Clear, grasslands: 1-in-6.
- Barren lands, hills, mountains, woods: 2-in-6.
- Desert, jungle, swamp: 3-in-6.

### [Effects of Being Lost](name:effects_of_being_lost)

If the roll indicates that the party is lost, the referee will decide which direction they are actually travelling in. One option is to pick a direction only slightly off course. For example, if the group intended to go south, they are actually headed southwest or west.

It may take some time for a lost party to realise that it is moving in the wrong direction.

## [Mercenaries](name:mercenaries)

Mercenaries are typically hired as soldiers and will guard, patrol, and otherwise serve in wilderness settings, but only as part of a larger force, not an adventuring group.

Note that as mercenaries are hired by a character to perform specific services, they are not treated as retainers and thus do not count toward a character's maximum number of retainers.

### [Locating and Hiring](name:mercenary_locating_and_hiring)

Mercenaries may be located by frequenting pubs or by posting notices of help wanted. There may also be guilds that can act as a contact point for recruiting mercenaries.

The most commonly found types of mercenary are listed in the following table, along with their monthly rates of pay.

### [Wages and Upkeep](name:mercenary_wages_and_upkeep)

The monthly rate of pay includes food and basic gear. Most mercenaries already have weapons and armour when hired, though their employer may equip them with additional gear. Note that armourers (see [***Specialists***](#specialists)) are required to repair mercenaries' armour and weapons.

### [Common Mercenary Types](name:common_mercenary_types)

Type | Weapons | AC | Base Morale | Human | Dwarf | Elf | Orc | Goblin
-------|----------|---|---|-----|---|------|-----|----
Archer | Shortbow | 6 | 8 | 5gp | -- | 10gp | 3gp | 2gp
Archer, mounted | Shortbow | 9 | 9 | 15gp | -- | 30gp | -- | --
Crossbowman | Crossbow | 5 | 8 | 4gp | 6gp | -- | 2gp | --
Crossbowman, mounted | Crossbow | 9 | 9 | -- | 15gp | -- | -- | --
Footman, light | Sword | 6 | 8 | 2gp | -- | 4gp | 1gp | 5sp
Footman, heavy | Sword | 4 | 8 | 3gp | 5gp | 6gp | 15sp | --
Horseman, light | Lance | 7 | 9 | 10gp | -- | 20gp | -- | --
Horseman, med. | Lance | 5 | 9 | 15gp | -- | -- | -- | --
Horseman, heavy | Lance, sword | 3 | 9 | 20gp | -- | -- | -- | --
Longbowman | Longbow, sword | 5 | 8 | 10gp | -- | 20gp | -- | --
Peasant | None | 9 | 6 | 1gp | -- | -- | -- | --
Wolf rider | Spear | 7 | 9 | -- | -- | -- | -- | 5gp

***Wage per Month:*** This is the rate of pay out of wartime. In wartime, all wages are doubled.  
***AC:*** 9 = no armour; 7 = leather; 6 = leather + shield; 5 = chainmail; 4 = chainmail + shield; 3 = plate mail.

### [Morale](name:mercenary_morale)

Like retainers, mercenaries have a morale rating. However, the morale rating of a group of mercenaries is determined solely by their type---it does not depend on the CHA of the hiring character.

The table of common mercenary types to the left lists their basic morale rating, but the following chart may be used to calculate the morale of other types of mercenary:

**Mercenary Type** | **Morale**
------------------|---
Peasants, Militia | 6
Barbarians | 7
Soldiers, Men-at-arms | 8
Mounted soldiers | +1
Elite soldiers | +1
Fanatic soldiers, Berserkers | +2

#### [Modifiers](name:modifiers)

At the referee's discretion, the morale score of a group of mercenaries may be modified based on working conditions. If the mercenaries are being killed frequently or subjected to other abuses, morale will be low. If the mercenaries are enjoying riches and excitement, it might be higher.

## [Movement](name:movement)

See also: [***Air Travel***](#air_travel), [***Water Travel***](#water_travel).

Each character has a base movement rate. The default is 120', but this may be modified by a character's class or by the amount of gear carried (if the optional [***Encumbrance***](#encumbrance) rules are used).

If the group wants to stay together, they may only move as quickly as the slowest character.

### [Dungeon Exploration](name:dungeon_exploration)

A character can move his or her movement rate in feet in one turn (see [***Time***](#time)) when exploring unknown areas of a dungeon. This (very slow!) rate of movement takes account for the fact that PCsare exploring, watching their footing, mapping, and taking care to be quiet and to avoid obstacles.

When moving through dungeon areas they are familiar with, the referee may allow characters to move at a faster rate. For example, the referee may allow characters to move at three times their base movement rate, when moving through familiar areas. Thus, a character whose base movement rate is 120' could move 360' in a turn.

### [Movement in Encounters](name:movement_in_encounters)

During encounters, a character can move up to one third of his or her movement rate per round in feet (in the dungeon) or yards (in the wilderness). For example, a character whose base movement rate is 120' could move 40' per round during a dungeon encounter. Characters may move at this rate for at most 60 rounds (one turn).

### [Running](name:running)

During encounters, a character may choose to run at up to his or her full movement rate per round in feet (in the dungeon) or yards (in the wilderness). Characters may only move at this rate for 30 rounds before becoming exhausted: suffering a &minus;2 penalty to attacks, damage, and Armour Class (AC is increased by 2). The penalties for exhaustion last until characters have rested for three full turns.

Clearly, it is not possible to maintain a map while running.

### [Overland Travel](name:overland_travel)

When travelling in the wilderness, the distance a character can travel in a normal day's march is determined by dividing his or her base movement rate by five. This is the number of miles travelled in a day. For example, a character whose base movement rate is 120' could travel up to 24 miles in a day.

Some types of terrain modify the speed at which characters can travel:

- Broken lands, desert, forest, hills: 33% slower.
- Jungle, mountains, swamp: 50% slower.
- Maintained roads: 50% faster.

### [Forced March](name:forced_march)

If they need to travel further in one day, characters may engage in a forced march. A forced march is a day of hard, tiring, overland travel, but increases travel speed by 50%. For example, a character who can normally travel 24 miles in a day can travel 36 miles on a forced march. After a forced march, the characters must rest for a full day.

## [Resting](name:resting)

### [In the Dungeon](name:resting_in_the_dungeon)

Characters can explore, fight, or otherwise remain active for five turns before needing to rest for one turn.

### [In the Wilderness](name:resting_in_the_wilderness)

During wilderness travel, characters must rest one day per six days of travel.

### [After a Forced March](name:after_a_forced_march)

After a forced march, characters must rest for a full day.

### [After Running](name:after_running)

Characters who have been running for more than 30 rounds must rest for three full turns to recover.

### [Penalty for Not Resting](name:penalty_for_not_resting)

If characters press on without resting, they suffer a penalty of &minus;1 to hit and damage rolls until they have rested for the required length of time. After running, this penalty is increased to &minus;2 and additionally applied to Armour Class (AC is raised by 2).

## [Retainers](name:retainers)

Retainers are NPCs that are hired by characters for extra hands during an adventure. Each character is limited to a finite number of retainers, which is indicated by the character's Charisma score (see [***Ability Scores***](#ability_scores)). Retainers are not mindless slaves and, although they will usually share the party's risks, they will not willingly act as battle fodder. If abused in any way, retainers will typically warn others of this and the PCs will soon find it difficult to hire other retainers.

### [Locating](name:locating)

A PC who wants to hire a retainer must first locate possible candidates. The PC might simply walk up to strangers in taverns, might contact adventurers' guilds, or might advertise by putting up fliers or by other means.

### [Hiring](name:hiring)

Retainers are recruited through negotiation, with the referee playing the roles of the NPCs a character attempts to hire. The PC should explain what the job entails and the rates of pay: for example, a percentage of any treasure recovered or a flat rate of pay. The hiring PC must also typically pay for the retainer's daily upkeep (food and lodgings) and for any new adventuring gear, weapons, or mounts the retainer will require for the adventure.

### [Reactions](name:reactions)

After an offer is made, the referee rolls 2d6 on the table below to decide the potential retainer's reaction. The roll is modified by the hiring character's CHA and the referee may apply a bonus or penalty, depending on the attractiveness of the deal (+1 or +2 for generous offers, &minus;1 or &minus;2 for poor offers).

2d6 | Result
---|---
2 or less | Offer refused *
3--5 | Offer refused
6--8 | Roll again
9--11 | Offer accepted
12 or more | Offer accepted &dagger;

\* _The potential retainer reacts so negatively to the offer that he or she spreads negative rumours about the PC, which results in a &minus;1 penalty on any further hiring reaction rolls while recruiting in the same town or area._  
&dagger; _The offer is accepted in very good spirits and the retainer's morale is increased by one._

### [Class and Level](name:class_and_level)

Retainers can be of any class (including normal humans of level 0), but must be of equal or lower level to the PC who has hired them.

### [Morale](name:retainer_morale)

Retainers have a morale rating, determined by the hiring character's CHA (see Ability Scores, p4). This rating may be adjusted at the referee's discretion: it may be increased if the PC has been particularly good to the retainer (e.g. repeatedly given additional treasure) or reduced if the PC has been cruel or contrary to his or her word.

To make a morale check, the referee rolls 2d6 and, if the result is lower than or equal to the retainer's morale rating, accounting for any adjustments, the roll has succeeded.

Morale rolls are made in two circumstances:

- Each time the retainer is exposed to a particularly perilous situation. If the roll fails, the retainer will likely flee.
- At the end of an adventure. If the roll fails, the NPC will not work for the PC again.

### [Experience](name:experience)

Although retainers are "played" by the referee, they acquire experience in the same way PCs do, can advance in level, and are affected by all of the same class rules. Because retainers follow instructions when on an adventure, thus not directly engaging in problem solving, they suffer a penalty of &minus;50% to XP.

## [Saving Throws](name:saving_throws)

All characters and monsters can make saving throws to avoid the full effects of spells or certain attacks. Characters and monsters have a rating for each saving throw category (death ray or poison; magic wands; paralysis or turn to stone; dragon breath; rods, staves, or spells). Saving throw tables for the standard classes (also used by monsters) are given in [***Standard Combat Charts***](#standard_combat_charts).

The appropriate saving throw to make and the effects of a success or failure will be indicated in the description of the spell, monster attack, or adventure scenario.

### [Rolling a Saving Throw](name:rolling_a_saving_throw)

When affected by a spell or attack form which requires a saving throw, the player or referee must roll 1d20. A result that is greater than or equal to the value listed for the saving throw is a success. A result of less than the listed value is a failure.

### [Successful Saves](name:successful_saves)

A successful saving throw against an effect that causes damage means that the damage is halved. A successful saving throw against an effect that does not cause damage means the effect has been entirely avoided or negated.

### [Saves vs Poison](name:saves_vs_poison)

A failed save against poison is usually fatal. If a poisonous attack also inflicts damage, the damage is not affected by the success or failure of the saving throw.

### [Item Saving Throws](name:item_saving_throws)

If a character is killed by a destructive spell or special attack (e.g. a lightning bolt spell or dragon's breath), his or her equipment is assumed to be destroyed. Magic items may be allowed a saving throw, using the character's saving throw values. Items which grant a bonus in combat (e.g. magical weapons and armour) may also apply this bonus to the saving throw.

## [Searching](name:searching)

Dungeons often include hidden features and mechanisms such as secret doors and traps. Adventurers can spot these by searching. The player must declare the particular object or 10' &times; 10' area to be searched. Searching takes one turn.

If a character is searching in the right location, there is a base 1-in-6 chance of finding a secret door or trap. (Some types of adventurer may have an increased chance.) The referee should always roll for the character searching, so that the player never knows if the roll failed or if there simply are no hidden features in the area searched.

Each character can only make one attempt to search any given object or 10' &times; 10' area.

## [Specialists](name:specialists)

All types of character that PCs may wish to hire for non-combat and non-adventuring purposes (i.e. not mercenaries or retainers) are termed specialists.

Note that as specialists are hired by a character to perform specific services, they are not treated as retainers and thus do not count toward a character's maximum number of retainers.

### [Locating and Hiring](name:specialist_locating_and_hiring)

Specialists may be located by frequenting pubs or by posting notices of help wanted. There may also be guilds which can act as a contact point for recruiting specialists.

### [Wages and Upkeep](name:pecialist_wages_and_upkeep)

Several possible types of specialist are described below, along with their typical monthly pay rates. The monthly rate of pay includes food and basic gear. This list is not exhaustive and the referee may create additional types of specialist as needed.

Specialist | Wage per Month
----------|--------
Alchemist | 1,000gp
Animal trainer | 500gp
Armourer | 100gp
Assistant armourer | 15gp&dagger;
Blacksmith | 25gp
Engineer | 750gp
Navigator | 150gp
Oarsman | 2gp
Sage | 2,000gp
Sailor | 10gp
Ship's captain | 250gp
Spy | 500gp (or more)

&dagger; _Not defined in the traditional Expert rules; value extrapolated from similar specialists._

### [Descriptions](name:descriptions)

#### [Alchemist](name:alchemist)

Alchemists dedicate their expertise to creating potions and other concoctions. Based on a sample or recipe, an alchemist can produce a potion at twice the normal speed and for half the normal cost (see [***Magical Research***](#magical_research)). An alchemist may also research new potions, but this takes twice as long and costs twice as much as normal.

#### [Animal Trainer](name:animal_trainer)

All animal trainers are specialized in a particular kind of animal and can have up to six animals under their care at a time. Trainers are not required for small numbers of common animals like dogs, horses, or mules, but more exotic animals or larger numbers of normal animals require a specialized trainer.

The referee decides how long an animal must be trained, based on the nature of the training. It will take a minimum of one month to teach an animal the first new behaviour or trick. After this first month, an animal has become accustomed to the trainer and can be taught additional behaviours at twice the rate (two weeks per behaviour). If training is interrupted, all time already spent on that particular behaviour is lost and the animal becomes unable to learn further behaviours.

#### [Armourer](name:armourer)

An armourer may either:

- Produce weapons and armour: Per month, an armourer can make five weapons, three shields, or one complete suit of armour.
- Maintain mercenaries' gear: One armourer is required per 50 troops.

The output of an armourer (either in terms of arms produced or troops maintained) may be doubled by hiring two assistant armourers and one blacksmith. If four assistants and two blacksmiths are hired, the armourer's output may be quadrupled. An armourer cannot coordinate more assistants than this.

#### [Assistant Armourer](name:assistant_armourer)

Apprentices who may work under an armourer to increase the rate of production. See _Armourer_.

#### [Blacksmith](name:blacksmith)

Craftsmen trained in the art of forging metal. Blacksmiths may be hired to work under an armourer to increase the rate of production. See _Armourer_.

#### [Engineer](name:engineer)

Engineers plan and oversee large construction projects, such as building [***Castles and Strongholds***](#castles_and_strongholds). The number of engineers required for a construction project depends on the overall cost of the building: one engineer is needed per 100,000 gp value of the project. Human engineers usually handle large aboveground structures, while dwarves may be hired for underground construction.

#### [Navigator](name:navigator)

A navigator is a sailor who understands how to read charts and navigate based on instruments and the position of the stars. Any time a ship ventures beyond sight of a coastline, it becomes lost if a navigator is not aboard. (See [***Losing Direction***](#losing_direction).)

#### [Oarsman](name:oarsman)

Unskilled normal humans who man the oars of sea vessels. They are not trained for combat.

#### [Sage](name:sage)

Sages are rare individuals who devote their lives to the study of an obscure and specific subject area (e.g. dragons, ancient history). A sage may be consulted for information in his or her specialist area. Characters may have to pay the monthly rate in addition to any other supplies the sage needs to research their question, as determined by the referee. If the information is particularly difficult to obtain, it will cost the characters extra. In addition, despite the special knowledge sages have, they are occasionally wrong when it comes to particularly obscure questions. The referee will decide what questions are obscure and the probability of achieving a wrong answer. If the characters receive a wrong answer, they may not realize it!

#### [Sailor](name:sailor)

Skilled normal humans who can handle a ship. Sailors can fight to defend their ship, typically being equipped with a sword, shield, and leather armour.

#### [Ship's Captain](name:ships_captain)

A captain is required for any large ship, is skilled like a sailor, and has an intimate knowledge of the particular coasts he or she frequents.

#### [Spy](name:spy)

A spy is hired to gather information about a specific person or group. The spy may be an outsider who tries to infiltrate or may be a traitor already connected with the person or group to be spied upon. Spies are often NPC thieves, but may be of any character class. The referee will determine the time required for the job and the probability of success in the mission, based on the circumstances. Spies may or may not be reliable and could stab the hiring character in the back (perhaps literally!).

## [Starvation](name:starvation)

If characters go for a full day or more without food or water, the referee may begin to apply penalties to attack rolls and movement rate, require more frequent rests, or even begin to deduct hit points, in extreme cases.

## [Swimming](name:swimming)

Characters move at half their normal movement rate when swimming.

It is assumed that every character knows how to swim, unless there is some obvious reason why a character could not have learned.

### [Drowning](name:drowning)

Characters that are encumbered or in treacherous water conditions have a probability of drowning, at the referee's discretion. Heavily encumbered characters--wearing plate mail armour and/or carrying a large amount of treasure--will likely have above 90% chance of drowning. Characters carrying less treasure or wearing lighter armour may have as little as 10% chance of drowning.

## [Time](name:time)

Aside from normal time increments (minutes, hours, days, and so on), the following special units are used in the game. In all matters of time and movement, the referee is the final authority on what may be accomplished in a given period of time.

### [Turns](name:turns)

When in the dungeon, characters take actions in time increments called turns. One turn is equal to 10 minutes. Character actions that take one turn include looking for secret doors or traps in a 10' &times; 10' area (see [***Searching***](#searching)).

### [Rounds](name:rounds)

Rounds are ten seconds of game time each, so there are 60 rounds in a turn. Time is only measured in rounds during encounters, especially in combat (see [***Encounters***](#encounters)).

## [Traps](name:traps)

### [Triggering](name:triggering)

Each trap is triggered by a specific action (e.g. opening a door or walking over a particular area). Every time a character makes an action that could trigger a trap, there is a 2-in-6 chance of the trap being sprung. Some traps may be more or less likely to trigger, if the referee wishes.

### [Searching for Traps](name:searching_for_traps)

Adventurers may choose to search objects or areas for traps. See [***Searching***](#searching).

## Travel

### [Land Transportation](name:land_transportation)

#### [Animals of Burden](name:animals_of_burden)

Animal | Cost (gp) | Miles per Day | Movement Rate | Maximum Encumbrance (Coins)
------|-----|----|------------|------
Camel | 100 | 30 | 150' (50') | 6,000
Horse (draft) | 40 | 18 | 90' (30') | 9,000
Horse (riding) | 75 | 48 | 240' (80') | 6,000
Horse (war) | 250 | 24 | 120' (40') | 8,000
Mule | 30 | 24 | 120' (40') | 4,000

***Movement Rate:*** Distance moved in one exploration turn; per-round encounter movement rate in parentheses.

***Max Encumbrance (Coins):*** Burdens of up to half the listed maximum do not affect movement rate; greater burdens (up to the maximum listed encumbrance) reduce movement to half speed.

#### [Tack and Harness](name:tack_and_harness)

Item | Cost (gp)
-----|----------
Barding | 150
Saddle and bridle | 25
Saddle bags| 5

#### [Vehicles](name:vehicles)

Vehicle | Cost (gp) | Miles per Day | Movement Rate | Max Load (Coins)
-----|-----|----|-----------|--------------
Cart | 100 | 12 | 60' (20') | 4,000 / 8,000
Wagon | 200 | 12 | 60' (20') | 15,000 / 25,000

***Movement Rate:*** Distance moved in one exploration turn; per-round encounter movement rate in parentheses.

***Max Load (Coins):*** The maximum load of a vehicle depends on the number of animals pulling it. See descriptions.

#### [Descriptions](name:vehicle_descriptions)

_(Full descriptions and stats for animals are found in [**Monsters**](#monsters).)_

***Barding:*** Armour constructed of leather and plates of metal. Provides the animal with an AC of 5 and weighs 600 coins.

***Camel:*** AC 7, HD 2, 1 &times; hoof (1d4) + 1 &times; bite (1), Ml 7, SA Fighter 1.

***Cart:*** A two-wheeled vehicle. Pulled by a single draft horse or two mules, a cart may be loaded with up to 4,000 coins of weight. Pulled by two draft horses or four mules, it may carry up to 8,000 coins. When travelling through difficult terrain (e.g. desert, forest, mountains, swamp), can only travel on maintained roads.

***Horse, draft:*** AC 7, HD 3, no attacks, Ml 6, SA Fighter 2.

***Horse, riding:*** AC 7, HD 2, 2 &times; hoof (1d4), Ml 7, SA Fighter 1.

***Horse, war:*** AC 7, HD 3, 2 &times; hoof (1d6), Ml 9, SA Fighter 2.

***Mule:*** AC 7, HD 2, 1 &times; kick (1d4) or 1 &times; bite (1d3), Ml 8, SA Normal Human.

***Saddle bags:*** Hold up to 300 coins weight.

***Wagon:*** A four-wheeled, open vehicle. Pulled by two draft horse or four mules, a wagon may be loaded with up to 15,000 coins of weight. Pulled by four draft horses or eight mules, it may carry up to 25,000 coins. When travelling through difficult terrain (e.g. desert, forest, mountains, swamp), can only travel on maintained roads.

### [Air Travel](name:air_travel)

When travelling by air, the total number of miles a character can travel in a day is twice the distance he or she could travel overland (see [***Movement***](#movement)).

This rate might be reduced if there are adverse conditions such as very high mountains, storms, or thick fog. There are many magical items that grant characters the ability to fly, as well as spells and winged mounts.

#### [Mounts](name:mounts)

In general, a winged beast may carry riders or other burdens based on its Hit Dice:

- 3 HD creatures may carry a being about half the size of an adult human.
- 6 HD creatures may carry an adult human.
- 12 HD creatures may carry a large animal like a horse or four adult humans.
- 24 HD creatures may carry a very a large animal, or four horses, or eight adult humans.

### [Water Travel](name:water_travel)

The distance travelled in a day is determined by the type of vessel being used and by the prevailing wind and water conditions.

When travelling upon **rivers**, the current may increase (moving downstream) or decrease(moving upstream) the distance travelled by 1d6+6 miles per day.

**At sea**, there are many possible conditions that might impact a vessel's movement rate. The referee should check conditions at the start of each day by rolling 2d6:

- A result of 2 means that the day is completely devoid of wind and a ship that is incapable of rowing cannot move all day.
- A result of 12 indicates a gale (see below).

#### [Gales](name:gales)

During a gale, any vessel with sails can attempt to move with the wind to avoid damage. The vessel travels at three times its normal speed in a randomly determined direction. (The referee may roll 1d6, with 1 indicating the intended direction of travel, 2 indicating 60' to the right, 3 indicating 120' to the right, and so on.)

If the ship encounters land during this travel, there is a 75% chance of it wrecking against the shore.

#### [Variable Wind Conditions (Optional Rule)](name:variable_wind_conditions)

Groups who prefer a slightly more detailed system of sea travel may use the following chart, which adds additional detail to the daily 2d6 roll to determine wind conditions.

2d6 | Wind | Effect
---|---|---
2 | No wind | Movement is only possible by oar. Oarsmen fatigued: movement reduced by one third.
3 | Faint breeze | Movement rate reduced to one third normal.
4 | Gentle breeze | Movement rate reduced to half normal.
5 | Moderate breeze | Movement rate reduced to two thirds normal.
6--8 | Fresh breeze | Normal movement rate.
9 | Strong breeze | Movement rate increased by one third.
10 | High wind | Movement rate increased by half.
11 | Near gale | Movement rate doubled. 10% chance of taking on water (speed reduced by one third until repaired at a dock).
12 | Gale | Movement rate tripled. See [***Gales***](#gales), above.

### [Water Transportation](name:water_transportation)

The vessels described in this section span various historical periods from ancient galleys to medieval sailing ships. Vessels are propelled by rowing or sailing, with some able to use either means. The necessary crew and the resulting speeds are given on the following pages. The pay rates for crew are given in [***Specialists***](#specialists).

#### [Seaworthiness](name:seaworthiness)

Water vessels are divided into two broad categories: those which are suitable for use on the high seas and those which are restricted to rivers, lakes, or coastal waters.

##### [Dimensions](name:dimensions)

A ship's _beam_ is its width and its _draft_ is the depth it extends beneath the water.

##### [Seaworthy Vessels](name:seaworthy_vessels)

Vessel | Cost (gp) | Maximum Cargo (Coins) | Usage | Length | Beam | Draft

&dagger; _Not defined in the traditional Expert rules; value extrapolated from similar vessels._

##### [High Winds](name:high_winds)

Unseaworthy vessels are designed for use in rivers, lakes, or coastal waters, not on the open seas. They are thus not built to withstand high winds (see [***Water Travel***](#water_travel)). These vessels suffer as follows in extreme winds:

***Near gale:*** With the optional variable wind conditions rule, a result of 11 indicates near gale conditions. Unseaworthy vessels have a 20% chance (increased from the usual 10% chance) of taking on water.

***Gale:*** During gale conditions, unseaworthy vessels are affected as follows:

- There is an 80% chance of the vessel being overrun with water and sinking.
- Unseaworthy vessels with sails cannot move with the wind to avoid damage.
- If the vessel is in sight of land when the gale hits, it may attempt to beach. If the shore is relatively clear of physical dangers (rocks, cliffs, etc), this is automatically successful; otherwise there is a 2-in-6 chance of finding a safe harbour to weather the storm.

#### [Vessel Descriptions](name:vessel_descriptions)

***Boat, river:*** Riverboats are either rowed or pushed with poles. The cost of the boat increases by 1,000 gp if it has a roof (to protect passengers or cargo).

***Boat, sailing:*** A small boat typically used for fishing in lakes or coastal waters.

***Canoe:*** A small boat made of hide or canvas stretched over a wooden frame. Because of its small size and lightweight construction, a canoe may be carried by two people (weighing 500 coins).

***Galley, large:*** A long ship with a shallow draft and a single, square-sailed mast.

***Galley, small:*** A ship with a shallow draft and a single, square-sailed mast.

***Galley, war:*** A large, specially constructed galley that is generally a fleet's flagship. War galleys are always fitted with a ram (comes with the basic cost) and have a full deck above the rowers. They have two masts and 10'--20' wide wooden towers rising 15'--20' above the bow and stern.

***Lifeboat:*** A small boat with a mast that folds down for storage. A small ship usually has 1--2 lifeboats, while larger ships may have 3--4. A lifeboat weighs 5,000 coins and reduces the cargo capacity of the ship on which it is carried by this much. A lifeboat is usually equipped with rations to feed ten human-sized beings for one week.

***Longship:*** A narrow ship which may be used in rivers, coastal waters, or the open seas. A longship may be rowed or sailed, depending on the conditions. The crew typically fill the role of oarsmen, sailors, and fighters, as needed.

***Sailing ship, large:*** A large, seaworthy vessel with up to three masts. Usually has multiple decks and raised "castles" at the bow and stern.

***Sailing ship, small:*** A small, seaworthy vessel with a single mast.

***Troop transport (large, small):*** These ships have similar dimensions and characteristics to normal sailing ships, but are specially designed to carry troops, mounts, and equipment of war as their cargo.

***Warship (large, small):*** These ships have similar dimensions and characteristics to normal sailing ships, but are specially designed to carry mercenaries and war gear.

***Raft, makeshift:*** Given sufficient wood, characters may build a makeshift raft in 1--3 days per 10' square section (up to a maximum size of 20' &times; 30').

***Raft, professional:*** A professionally built raft has raised sides, a basic steering oar, and some form of shelter for goods or passengers. Such a raft may be up to 30' &times; 40'. Professionally built rafts are sometimes floated downstream with cargo and then broken down and sold for the value of their wood (25cp per square foot).

#### [Vessel Movement Rates and Crew](name:vessel_movement_rates_and_crew)

Vessel | Requires Captain? | Req. Oarsmen | Row Miles/Day | Row Movement Rate | Req. Sailors | Sail Miles/Day | Sail Movement Rate

\* _Crew may take on the roles of oarsmen, sailors, and fighters._  
&dagger; _Specialist crew not required. Unskilled characters (e.g. PCs) may pilot the vessel._

***Movement Rate:*** Distance moved in one exploration turn; per-round encounter movement rate in parentheses.

#### [Rowed Movement](name:rowed_movement)

For rowed vessels, the encounter movement rate represents a great effort on the part of the oarsmen. Such speeds cannot be maintained for long periods, thus the movement rates per turn and per day are much slower.

##### [Reduced Crew](name:reduced_crew)

Having less than the required number of oarsmen reduces a vessel's speed. For every 10% reduction in the available rowing crew, the vessel's rowing speed is reduced by an equal percentage. For example, if 10% of the oarsmen are being used to repair hull damage, the vessel moves at 90% of its normal speed (i.e. 10% slower than normal).

#### [Vessel Combat Stats](name:vessel_combat_stats)

Vessel | Maximum Mercenaries | Armour Class | Hull Points | Ram? | Catapult?
-------------|---|---|-------|---|---
Boat (river) | -- | 8 | 20--40 | -- | --

Warship (small) | 25 | 8 | 60--90 | -- | Up to 1

##### [Mercenaries](name:marines)

Some vessels have space aboard for mercenaries in addition to the normal crew of sailors/oarsmen. These mercenaries are optional and may be of any type. (See [***Mercenaries***](#mercenaries).)

##### [Hull Points](name:hull_points)

In combat, attacks and damage may be directed at water vessels in addition to characters and monsters. A water vessel has a number of hull points. These are analogous to a creature's hit points. Normal attacks (bows, swords, etc.) do not inflict hull damage, but spells, magical attacks, and the attacks of giant sea monsters inflict one point of hull damage per five points of normal hit point damage the attack does.

##### [Effects of Hull Damage](name:effects_of_hull_damage)

When a vessel loses hull points, its movement rate is also affected. This may be due to taking on water or because of structural damage influencing how the vessel passes through water. For every 10% a ship is reduced from its maximum hull points, its movement is reduced by an equal percentage. For example, if a ship loses 20% of its hull points, its movement is reduced by 20%.

When a vessel is reduced to 0 hull points, it will sink in 1d10 rounds. Any mounted weaponry is no longer functional.

##### [Repairs](name:repairs)

It takes five crew-members one turn to repair one hull point. This task requires full attention, so any crew involved in repair cannot take any other action during a turn repairing a vessel. Only half of all damage sustained to a ship can be repaired at sea by the crew, the remaining damage can only be repaired by facilities at a dock.

#### [Ship Modifications](name:ship_modifications)

The following modifications may be made to an existing ship:

- A sailing ship may be converted into a warship or troop transport of the same size. The modification costs one-third of the ship's original cost.
- A catapult may be added to a galley, longship, or warship.
- A ram may be added to a large or small galley (a war galley already comes with a ram fitted).

#### [Ship Weaponry](name:ship_weaponry)

Item | Cost (gp)
---------|-----
Catapult | 100
Catapult shot | 5
Catapult shot, pitch | 25
Ram, large galley | 10,000
Ram, small galley | 3,000

#### [Weaponry Descriptions](name:weaponry_descriptions)

***Catapult:*** Fires either large rocks or flaming pitch and may be operated by 2--4 crew. A catapult, along with twenty rounds of shot, weighs 10,000 coins. This must be subtracted from the ship's cargo allowance.

The range of attacks is 150--300 yards. Attack rolls may be modified for weather conditions, manoeuvrability, etc. Attacks are made as a fighter of level equal to the number of crew manning the catapult (minimum 2, maximum 4). The rate of fire also depends on the number of crew: every 5 rounds with four crew, every 8 rounds with three crew, or every 10 rounds with two crew.

***Catapult shot:*** Inflicts 3d6 hull points of damage against ships.

***Catapult shot, pitch:*** Sets a 10'&times;10' area of a ship on fire. The burning does 1d6 hull points of damage per turn (for at least one turn) and will spread to other areas of the ship, if not extinguished. A fire may be put out by five crew in 3 turns, ten crew in 2 turns, or fifteen crew in 1 turn.

***Ram:*** War galleys have a ram built in. A ram may be added to a large or small galley. Attacks with a ram are made using the attack chart for 1st level fighters and occur at the same point in the combat sequence as missile fire. Attack rolls may be modified for weather conditions, manoeuvrability, etc. A ram can only be used against large targets (e.g. other ships or giant sea monsters); small individuals cannot be targeted.

- Large or war galley: Deals 1d6+5 &times; 10 hull points damage against ships and 6d6 hit points damage against monsters.
- Small galley: Deals 1d4+4 &times; 10 hull points damage against ships and 3d8 hit points damage against monsters.

## [Wandering Monsters](name:wandering_monsters)

Besides the monsters specifically placed in certain regions of a dungeon or wilderness, the party may randomly encounter monsters on the move between areas. These are known as "wandering monsters". The chance of a random encounter occurring depends on the type of area being explored (e.g. dungeon region or level, type of wilderness terrain). Each type of area should have its own table of wandering monsters, which the referee rolls on when an encounter takes place.

### [In the Dungeon](name:monsters_in_the_dungeon)

The typical chance of encountering a wandering monster is 1-in-6, rolled every two turns. The chance of wandering monsters may be higher or lower in certain parts of the dungeon and the actions of the party can also affect this. For example, making a lot of noise or light should increase the chance, while resting quietly in an out-of-the-way location should decrease the chance.

### [In the Wilderness](name:monsters_in_the_wilderness)

It is usual to check for random encounters once per day, though the referee may make more checks: up to three or four per day. The chance of encounters depends on the terrain being explored:

- City, clear, grasslands, settled lands: 1-in-6.
- Aerial, barren, desert, forest, hills, ocean, river: 2-in-6.
- Jungle, mountains, swamp: 3-in-6.

Aquatic encounters may occur either on the open water or on land, if the party docks at some point during the day.

# [Adventure Scenarios](name:adventure_scenarios)

The first step in designing an adventure of any kind is to decide on the type of scenario. This is the hook that draws the player characters to the adventure site, and provides a background theme that the referee can use to tie the location together. The scenario drives the referee's choices of specific traps, treasures, and monsters to be placed in the location. The following examples may be used for inspiration.

## [1. Banishing Ancient Evil](name:banishing_ancient_evil)

An evil presence (e.g. a monster or NPC) must be banished or destroyed. It may have been dormant for many years, and have only recently been awakened (perhaps as a result of another party's meddling).

## [2. Clearing Ruins](name:clearing_ruins)

Settlers plan to move into an abandoned settlement or stronghold. Before they arrive, the PCs need to scout the area and clear out any monsters or other dangers that inhabit the place. The ruins need not be in a remote area---they could even be within (or beneath) a major settlement.

## [3. Contacting a Lost Civilisation](name:contacting_a_lost_civilisation)

The PCs discover a long-lost race in a fantastic location. They may have once been human, but are now adapted to their strange environment. For example, they may have reverted to bestial behaviour, or may be adapted to subterranean life, with pale skin and infravision.

## [4. Escaping from Captivity](name:escaping_from_captivity)

The PCs have been taken prisoner by an enemy, and begin the adventure in captivity, possibly with a grisly fate awaiting them in the near future. They must regain their freedom.

## [5. Exploring Unknown Territory](name:exploring_unknown_territory)

An NPC hires the party to explore and map an unknown region. This may be a previously uncharted area, or may be a recent alteration to a familiar region (e.g. a magic castle may appear in an empty plain).

## [6. Performing a Quest](name:performing_a_quest)

A deity or powerful NPC (e.g. a king) sends the PCs on a quest. This may involve recovering holy or magical items.

## [7. Rescuing Captives](name:rescuing_captives)

Important NPCs have been kidnapped by bandits, wicked monsters, or an evil wizard. The PCs attempt to rescue the prisoners, either seeking a reward, or because of a personal connection with the unfortunate captives. It is also possible that the PCs may be hired as bodyguards to NPCs who are negotiating with the kidnappers.

## [8. Scouting an Enemy Outpost](name:scouting_an_enemy_outpost)

An invasion is looming (or in progress)! The PCs are tasked with infiltrating an outpost of the enemy, gathering reconnaissance as to their plans, strengths, and weaknesses, and (if possible) destroying them.

## [9. Seeking a Magical Doorway](name:seeking_a_magical_doorway)

A gateway exists that allows magical travel (either one-way, or bidirectional) between distant locations or even other worlds. The PCs may be tasked with locating a lost portal, or closing a portal used by enemies. The portal may also be the only means of travel to a fantastic destination that the PCs must visit.

## [10. Visiting a Sacred Site](name:visiting_a_sacred_site)

In order to consult with an oracle, remove a curse, or find a holy relic, the PCs must journey to a sacred site (e.g. a shrine or temple). The exact location of the site is usually a matter of conjecture.

# [Designing a Dungeon](name:designing_a_dungeon)

## [1. Choose Setting](name:dungeon_choose_setting)

The central location of an adventure is often a dungeon of some kind. The referee should decide on the basic form and structure of the dungeon, and can begin to come up with ideas for the main rooms or areas. The following table may be used to decide the basic form.

d6 | Setting
--|----------------------
1 | Crypt or tomb complex
2 | Natural caverns
3 | Settlement (e.g. castle, village, city)
4 | Subterranean delving (e.g. mine)
5 | Temple
6 | Tower or fortification

## [2. Choose Monsters](name:choose_monsters)

Based on the selected [***adventure scenario***](#adventure_scenarios) and dungeon setting, the referee should decide what types of monsters inhabit the dungeon. Monsters may be selected from [***Monsters***](#monsters) or other monster books that the referee has available. The referee may also wish to create new monsters specially for the dungeon, or to alter standard monsters to tailor them to the location.

## [3. Map the Dungeon](name:map_the_dungeon)

Typically, dungeon maps are drawn on graph paper, with a scale of 10' per square. (Larger or smaller scales may be used, as appropriate.) The overall shape of the dungeon---the structure of the rooms and connecting passages (e.g. rough, cavern walls; carefully laid-out defensive structures; etc.)---will be determined by the dungeon setting.

Each area (e.g. room or cave) of the dungeon should be numbered, so that the area on the map can easily be cross-referenced with the description of its contents (see step 4).

## [4. Stock the Dungeon](name:stock_the_dungeon)

The referee should note down a description of each numbered area from the map.

- The description should note any monsters, traps, tricks, treasures, or special magical effects that are present (including the possibility of patrols in the area).
- Generally, the level of danger and the amount of treasure in a dungeon should be suitable to the level of the PCs.
- Additional, descriptive details for each area may also be noted: furnishings, everyday items, smells, sounds, lights, etc.

Monsters or areas that play an important role in the adventure background should be noted first. Areas of less importance may then be stocked, using the guidelines to the right, as desired.

### [Unguarded Treasure](name:unguarded_treasure)

Treasure is usually guarded by monsters or traps, but sometimes an unguarded cache of treasure may be found. The following guidelines should be borne in mind:

- When designing dungeons for experienced players, the referee should consider placing only very few completely unguarded treasures.
- The referee may wish to not place any unguarded treasures in the 9th or deeper dungeon levels.

### [Random Dungeon Room Contents](name:random_dungeon_room_contents)

d6 | Room Type | Chance of Treasure
----|-------|-------
1--2 | Empty | 1-in-6
3--4 | Monster | 3-in-6
5 | Special | None
6 | Trap | 2-in-6

- ***Monsters:*** May be selected by hand or rolled (see [***Dungeon Encounter Tables***](#dungeon_encounter_tables)).
- ***Specials:*** Unusual, magical, or weird features of an area. This can include tricks or puzzles.
- ***Traps:*** If treasure is present, the trap may be set so that it is triggered when the treasure is tampered with (a _treasure trap_). Otherwise, the trap may be triggered by simply entering the room or a certain area of it (a _room trap_).
- ***Treasure:*** If a monster is in the room, roll the treasure type indicated in its description. Otherwise, the treasure depends on the dungeon level.

### [Example Room Traps](name:example_room_traps)

1. ***Falling block:*** Inflicts 1d10 damage (**save vs petrification** to avoid).
2. ***Gas:*** Poisonous gas fills the room (**save vs poison** or die).
3. ***Mist:*** Harmless; looks like poisonous gas.
4. ***Pit:*** Opens up beneath characters' feet. Characters who fall in suffer damage when they hit the bottom (see [***Falling***](#falling)).
5. ***Scything blade:*** Swings from the ceiling; attacks for 1d8 damage.
6. ***Slide:*** Opens up beneath characters' feet, sending them to a lower level.

## [Example Specials](name:example_specials)

1. ***Alarms:*** Entry alarm that attracts nearby guardians.
2. ***Animating objects:*** Inanimate objects that attack if disturbed.
3. ***Falling blocks:*** Stone block falls to prevent passage.
4. ***Illusions:*** Illusionary passages, doors, or stairways.
5. ***Shifting architecture:*** Doors lock; room rotates, rises, or falls.
6. ***Strange waters:*** Pool or fountain with weird, magical effects.
7. ***Teleports:*** Magical portal or teleporter to another area of the dungeon.
8. ***Trapdoors:*** Leading to a hidden area.
9. ***Voices:*** Walls or architectural features speak or moan (e.g. a talking statue).

## [Example Treasure Traps](name:example_treasure_traps)

1. ***Darts:*** 1d6 spring-loaded darts fire at the character, doing 1d4 damage each.
2. ***Hidden monster:*** Released when the treasure is tampered with (e.g. a snake).
3. ***Illusion:*** Typically of a monster. The monster has AC 9 and vanishes if hit in combat. Attacks do not inflict real damage: a character who appears to die actually falls unconscious for 1d4 turns.
4. ***Light flash:*** Causes blindness for 1d8 turns (**save versus spells**).
5. ***Spray:*** A mysterious liquid covers the character; monsters are attracted to the smell. The chance of wandering monsters is doubled for 1d6 hours.
6. ***Sprung needle:*** A needle coated with poison jabs out (**save vs poison** or die).

## [Treasure](name:treasure)

- ***Level 1:*** 1d6 &times; 100sp; 50%: 1d6 &times; 10gp; 5%: 1d6 gems; 2%: 1d6 pieces of jewellery; 2%: 1 magic item.
- ***Level 2--3:*** 1d12 &times; 100sp; 50%: 1d6 &times; 100gp; 10%: 1d6 gems; 5%: 1d6 pieces of jewellery; 8%: 1 magic item.
- ***Level 4--5:*** 1d6 &times; 1,000sp; 1d6 &times; 200gp; 20%: 1d6 gems; 10%: 1d6 pieces of jewellery; 10%: 1 magic item.
- ***Level 6--7:*** 1d6 &times; 2,000sp; 1d6 &times; 500gp; 30%: 1d6 gems; 15%: 1d6 pieces of jewellery; 15%: 1 magic item.
- ***Level 8--9:*** 1d6 &times; 5,000sp; 1d6 &times; 1,000gp; 40%: 1d12 gems; 20%: 1d12 pieces of jewellery; 20%: 1 magic item.

See [***Gems and Jewellery***](#gems_and_jewellery) for more details.

## [Dungeon Encounter Tables](name:dungeon_encounter_tables)

This section provides encounter tables by dungeon level, using the monsters found in [***Monsters***](#monsters). Referees who are using additional (or alternative) monsters should either adapt the tables to include these, or should create their own encounter tables. Special tables may also be created to reflect the different balance of monsters inhabiting a specific dungeon.

### [How to Roll an Encounter](name:dungeon_how_to_roll_an_encounter)

Roll 1d20 and look up the result on the column in the table below that corresponds to the dungeon level being explored. The result indicates the monster encountered, with the number appearing in parentheses.

### [Notes](name:dungeon_notes)

- ***NPC adventurers:*** Encounters with NPC adventuring parties are listed in the tables as "Basic Adventurers" or "Expert Adventurers". Guidelines for generating NPC adventurers can be found in [***NPC Parties***](#npc_parties).
- ***Number appearing:*** The values listed in the tables for some monsters do not match the values listed in [***Monsters***](#monsters). If desired, the referee may use the number appearing value listed in the monsters book, for consistency.

# [Designing a Wilderness](name:designing_a_wilderness)

## [1. Choose Setting](name:wilderness_choose_setting)

The referee should decide on the basic geography and climate of the region to be described: whether it primarily consists of mountains, forest, desert, etc. The size of the region should also be determined.

When starting a new campaign, it is recommended that the referee begin by detailing a small, self-contained area that can be expanded upon in time.

At this stage, the referee should also consider the nature of the milieu being detailed: the general level of technology, availability of magic, presence of different monsters and intelligent races, and so on.

## [2. Map the Region](name:map_the_region)

Using graph or hex paper, the referee should create a map of the wilderness area, marking on the major terrain features such as mountain ranges, rivers, seas, lakes, islands, forests, swamps, and so on. Real world maps may serve as inspiration as to the natural structure and relationship of terrain features.

Typically, a large scale map (24 miles per hex) is drawn first, followed by smaller scale maps (6 miles per hex) of certain areas, adding more detail.

## [3. Locate Human Realms](name:locate_human_realms)

The areas of the map that are controlled by humans should be marked on the map, bearing in mind the needs of human civilisation (rivers, farmland, etc.). The base town (see step 5) is typically located within one of these regions. The referee should also note the ruler of each human-controlled area, whether it be a petty lord, a mighty king, a consortium of merchants, etc.

## [4. Locate Non-Human Realms](name:locate_non_human_realms)

Regions that are controlled by other intelligent species that exist in the setting (e.g. demihumans, monstrous races, and so on) should be marked on the map, taking their preferred environment and lifestyle into account. Some intelligent species may keep domains with well-defined boundaries, while others may move around---hunting or raiding---within a more vaguely defined area.

The territories of significant, non-intelligent monsters may also be marked on the map at this stage.

## [5. Place the Base Town](name:place_the_base_town)

A base town for player characters should be located on the map, typically close to a river or road, near the centre of the map. This is where play will begin. The guidelines to the right may be used to help flesh out the base town.

## [6. Place Dungeons](name:place_dungeons)

The referee may place one or more dungeons on the map, somewhere in the vicinity of the base town. Dungeons are normally located around a day's journey from the base town---close enough that travel between the town and the dungeon is convenient, but not so close that the town is plagued by monsters from the dungeon.

## [7. Create Regional Encounter Tables](name:create_regional_encounter_tables)

The standard [***Wilderness Encounter Tables***](#wilderness_encounter_tables) may be suited for use in some areas of the campaign map. For other areas, the referee may prefer to create new tables, with a selection of monsters customised to the area. Special encounter tables should take account of the intelligent and monstrous species marked on the map.

## [Wilderness Encounter Tables](name:wilderness_encounter_tables)

This section provides encounter tables by terrain type, using the monsters found in [***Monsters***](#monsters). Referees who are using additional (or alternative) monsters should either adapt the tables to include these, or should create their own encounter tables.

### [How to Roll an Encounter](name:wilderness_how_to_roll_an_encounter)

Roll 1d8 and 1d12:

- Look up the d8 result on the column in the table below that corresponds to the terrain being explored. The result indicates which sub-table to consult.
- Look up the d12 result in the sub-table indicated.

### [Notes](name:wilderness_notes)

- ***Aerial encounters:*** Always use the ***Flyer*** table, in [sub-table 1](#sub_table_1), below.
- ***Lost World:*** In Lost World or prehistoric settings, any Animal result may be rolled on the ***Prehistoric Animal*** table, in [sub-table 2](#sub_table_2), below.
- ***NPC adventurers:*** Encounters with NPC adventuring parties are listed in the tables as "Basic Adventurers", "Expert Adventurers", "High-Level Cleric", "High-Level Fighter", or "High-Level Magic-User". Guidelines for generating NPC adventurers can be found in [***NPC Parties***](#npc_parties).

# [Designing a Base Town](name:designing_a_base_town)

## [1. Size](name:size)

Decide how large the base town is and roughly how many inhabitants it has:

Town Size | Inhabitants
----------|------------
Village | 50--999
Small Town | 1,000--4,999
Large Town | 5,000--14,999
City | 15,000+

## [2. Services](name:services)

The referee should make some notes on the presence of the following services that adventurers will require:

- ***Black market:*** For selling treasure and contacting thieves or smugglers.
- ***Guard:*** A town militia to keep the peace and protect the town. It may be useful to note whether the guards are open to bribery, and how frequently they patrol various areas of the town.
- ***Healing:*** A temple, church, or shrine where healing magic (possibly including means of raising the dead) is available.
- ***Lodgings:*** Inns or rooms to rent.
- ***Rumours:*** Places where notices are posted and gossip spreads.

## [3. Ruler](name:town_ruler)

The referee should decide how the town is ruled: whether by a local sheriff or mayor appointed by a lord, an elected council, a confederacy of merchants, etc. It is also possible that a high-level NPC adventurer (with attendant guards and magic) may rule the town.

## [4. Other NPCs](name:other_npcs)

Other important NPCs in the town should be noted, especially those associated with one of the services mentioned above, or those who might wish to hire the PCs to undertake missions.

## [5. Rumours](name:rumours)

A few local rumours may be noted, to provide hooks for the player characters to start exploring the local area, and possibly find their way to one of the placed dungeons.

# [Stronghold Encounters](name:stronghold_encounters)

High-level adventurers may create a base in a wilderness area by driving dangerous monsters out of the area, building a castle or stronghold, and hiring an army of mercenaries for protection. When PCs wander into the vicinity of such a stronghold, a warm reception is not always guaranteed. The referee may already have notes on the patrols around a stronghold, and the reaction of the ruler to travellers. If not, the following guidelines may be used.

## [Ruler](name:stronghold_ruler)

The referee should decide what class of NPC claims ownership of the stronghold and the surrounding lands:

- ***Arcane spell caster:*** (e.g. magic-user.) Of level 1d4+10.
- ***Divine spell caster:*** (e.g. cleric.) Of level 1d8+6.
- ***Warrior or combat-oriented character:*** (e.g. fighter.) Of level 1d6+8.

Note that demihuman strongholds are unusual cases, and should be detailed in advance by the referee. Typically, they will attempt to avoid all contact with travellers.

## [Patrols](name:patrols)

Adventurers who enter the dominion around a stronghold will typically be spotted by one of the mercenary groups hired to patrol the area. The type of troops depends on the class of the ruler:

- ***Arcane spell caster:*** 2d6 heavy footmen. Equipped with chainmail + shield (AC 4) and swords. Morale 8.
- ***Divine spell caster:*** 2d6 medium horsemen. Equipped with chainmail (AC 5) and lances. Morale 9.
- ***Warrior or combat-oriented character:*** 2d6 heavy horsemen. Equipped with plate mail (AC 3), lance, and sword. Morale 9.

## [Garrison](name:garrison)

Patrols such as those described are only a small part of the ruler's garrison. Further forces may include magical monsters, or humans mounted on flying creatures.

## [Reaction](name:reaction)

The reaction of the ruler to travellers in his or her domain depends on the class of the ruler, and can be determined by rolling 1d6 and consulting this table:

d6 | Arcane Caster | Divine Caster | Warrior
---|---------------|---------------|--------
1 | Chase | Chase | Chase
2 | Ignore | Chase | Chase
3 | Ignore | Ignore | Chase
4 | Ignore | Ignore | Ignore
5 | Ignore | Invite | Ignore
6 | Invite | Invite | Invite

***Chase:*** The patrol is instructed to chase intruders out of the domain. Alternatively, they may demand a toll from travellers passing through. The exact price demanded depends on the ruler's character, the apparent wealth of the PCs, etc. If the PCs refuse to pay the toll, the patrol may attack them, drive them away, or attempt to take them prisoner.

***Ignore:*** The patrol leaves the PCs to go about their business.

***Invite:*** The patrol brings a message from the domain's ruler, inviting the PCs to stay in the stronghold. The ruler's exact motive for doing so will depend on his or her personality---it is not necessarily benign.

# [NPC Parties](name:npc_parties)

This procedure generates parties of NPC adventurers. As the procedure is fairly involved, referees may wish to pre-generate some NPC parties for use in random encounters. The following general details apply to all types of NPC party described:

- ***Spells:*** If spell casters are present, choose or roll their memorized spells.
- ***Equipment:*** Normal adventuring gear.
- ***Treasure:*** Treasure types U+V, shared among the group.
- ***Marching order:*** Decided by referee.

If the classes presented in [***Charater Classes***](#character_classes) are not in use, the referee should replace the listed classes by equivalents in use in his or her campaign.

## [Basic Adventurers](name:basic_adventurers)

- ***Composition:*** 1d4+4 characters of random class and level (see below).
- ***Alignment:*** Either roll the alignment of each NPC or roll once for the party.

## [Expert Adventurers](name:expert_adventurers)

- ***Composition:*** 1d6+3 characters of random class and level (see below).
- ***Alignment:*** Either roll the alignment of each NPC or roll once for the party.
- ***Mounts:*** 75% chance of being mounted, in the wilderness.
- ***Magic items:*** Per individual: there is a chance of the NPC having a magic item from each suitable magic item sub-table (see [***Magic Items***](#magic_items)). The chance per sub-table is 5% per level of the NPC. Rolled items that cannot be used by the NPC should be ignored (no re-roll).

## [High-Level Cleric](name:high_level_cleric)

A high-level cleric and party. (Mounts and magic items as per Expert Adventurers.)

- ***Composition:*** Leader (cleric of level 1d6+6), 1d4 clerics (level 1d4+1), 1d3 fighters (level 1d6).
- ***Alignment:*** Roll for the whole party.

## [High-Level Fighter](name:high_level_fighter)

A high-level fighter and a group of retainers, often on their way to or from war. (Mounts and magic items as per Expert Adventurers.)

- ***Composition:*** Leader (fighter of level 1d4+6), 2d4 retainers (level 1d4+2, any class).
- ***Alignment:*** Roll for the whole party.

## [High-Level Magic-User](name:high_level_magic_user)

A high-level magic-user, accompanied by his or her apprentices and a group of hired guards, often on a quest for arcane lore. (Mounts and magic items as per Expert Adventurers.)

- ***Composition:*** Leader (magic-user of level 1d4+6), 1d4 apprentices (magic-users of level 1d3), 1d4 mercenaries (fighters of level 1d4+1).
- ***Alignment:*** Roll the leader's alignment. The apprentices have the same alignment as the leader, but the mercenaries may be of different alignment.

## [Adventurers' Class and Level](name:adventurers_class_and_level)

d8 | Class | Basic | Expert
---|-------|-------|-------
1 | Cleric | 1d3 | 1d6+3
2 | Dwarf | 1d3 | 1d6+6

# Treasure

## [Placing Treasure](name:placing_treasure)

There are two methods of deciding what treasure is in the possession of monsters encountered in an adventure, described below.

### [Rolling Randomly](name:rolling_randomly)

Monster listings (for example in [***Monsters***](#monsters)) note which treasure type is present in the creature's lair and which it may carry on its person. Each treasure type (described in the following section) lists one or more types of coin or item that may be found in the hoard. For each item in the list:

1. If a percentage value is given, roll d100 first. If the result is less than or equal to the listed percentage, this item is present in the hoard. If the result is greater than the listed percentage, this item is not present in the hoard.
2. If a range of values is given (e.g. 1d6 &times; 1,000cp, or 6d6 gems), roll the specified dice to determine the quantity of this item that is present in the hoard.
3. For gems, jewellery, and magic items, the procedures for determining the value and properties of the items in the hoard are found in later sections.

If the value of the randomly generated treasure is significantly above or below the average value of the treasure type, the referee may wish to adjust the results manually.

### [Referee Choice](name:referee_choice)

As an alternative to rolling treasure at random, the referee may wish to choose treasures appropriate to the monsters and the player character party. As treasure is the main source of player character experience (see [***Experience Points***](#experience_points))---usually accounting for 3/4 or more of their total experience earned---the referee should carefully consider treasure placement. The referee may use the following approach:

1. Consider the size of the adventuring party, the levels of the characters, and the XP requirements for them to advance.
2. Decide how many experience points the treasure hoard should provide, if the party successfully acquires it.
3. Place treasures whose total gold piece value matches the determined XP total.

When using this approach, the referee should ensure that the treasure is guarded by sufficiently powerful monsters. The player characters should have to earn this reward!

### [Items of Value](name:items_of_value)

The treasure tables in the following sections describe methods for generating hoards of coins, gems, jewellery, and magic items. Adventures may often include valuable items of other kinds, however, whose worth may not always be obvious to players. The referee should feel free to include items such as the following in treasure hoards:

- ***Artwork:*** Paintings, statuary.
- ***Books:*** Rare tomes or scrolls.
- ***Foodstuffs:*** Spices, valuable wines.
- ***Furnishings:*** Rugs, tapestries, hangings.
- ***Utensils:*** Silver cutlery, unusual kitchen or laboratory implements.
- ***Valuables:*** Furs, ivory, ores, silks.

For each such item placed, the referee should note its value (in gold pieces) and (if using the optional rules for [***Encumbrance***](#encumbrance)) its weight.

## [Treasure Types](name:treasure_types)

### [Hoards](name:hoards)

These treasure types indicate the sum wealth of a large monster or a community of smaller monsters. Such hoards are usually hidden in the monsters' lair. For monsters with a lair encounter size of greater than 1d4, the amount of treasure in the hoard may be reduced, if the number of monsters is below average.

#### [Type A (18,000gp average)](name:type_a)

- 25%: 1d6 &times; 1,000cp.

### [Average Values](name:average_values)

The average value of each treasure type is listed alongside the letter code. These values sum the average results of gems, jewellery, and all types of coin. Magic items that the treasure type may indicate are not counted toward the average value, as magic items do not have fixed sale values.

>Author's Note: According to my re-calculation of these averages, there were errors in the original Basic rules. The average value for treasure type M, in particular, was way off.

## [Gems and Jewellery](name:gems_and_jewellery)

### [Gems](name:gems)

For each gem present in a treasure hoard, roll on the following table to determine its gold piece value:

#### [Gem Values](name:gem_values)

d20 | Gem Value
----|----------
1--4 | 10gp
5--9 | 50gp
10--15 | 100gp
16--19 | 500gp
20 | 1,000gp

#### [Combining Gem Values](name:combining_gem_values)

When a treasure type indicates the presence of multiple gems, the referee may combine the values of individual gems, as desired. For example, a roll of five 50gp value gems may be placed as a single 250gp gem, a 100gp gem and three 50gp gems, or any other combination.

### [Jewellery](name:jewellery)

Each piece of jewellery indicated by a treasure type is worth 3d6 &times; 100gp. (For characters of 4th level and above, the referee may decide to place pieces of jewellery of even greater value.)

#### [Combining Jewellery Values](name:combining_jewellery_values)

As with gems (see above), the referee may combine the values of individual pieces of jewellery, as desired.

#### [Damaged Jewellery](name:damaged_jewellery)

Rough treatment of jewellery (for example crushing, intense heat or fire, lightning) can damage it, reducing its value by 50%.

# [Magic Items](name:treasure_magic_items)

## [Rolling Magic Items](name:rolling_magic_items)

If a treasure type indicates a specific type of magic item (e.g. 3 potions), roll on the table for that type of item (see below). Otherwise, first roll on the Magic Item Type table to determine the type of the item, then roll on the table for that type.

## [Basic and Expert Magic Items](name:basic_and_expert_magic_items)

Separate probabilities are listed in each table for Basic and Expert level characters (i.e. characters of 1st to 3rd level, and characters of 4th level or higher). The Basic probabilities are listed in the B column, and the Expert probabilities in the X column.

It is recommended that the probabilities appropriate to the group's experience level be used. Alternatively, if the referee prefers to have an even distribution of magic items, irrespective of player character level, the Expert probabilities may always be used.

## [Magic Item Type](name:magic_item_type)

B: d% | X: d% | Type of Item
------|-------|-------------
1--10 | 1--10 | Armour
11--15 | 11--15 | Misc. Item
16--40 | 16--35 | Potion
41--45 | 36--40 | Rin
46--65 | 41--70 | Scroll or Map
66--85 | 71--90 | Sword
86--90 | 91--95 | Wand/Staff/Rod
91--00 | 96--00 | Weapon

## [Identifying Magic Items](name:identifying_magic_items)

- ***Testing:*** The most common way of identifying magic items is by trial and error---sipping a potion, donning a suit of armour, using a weapon in battle, etc.
- ***Retainers:*** Players may wish to use retainers as "guinea pigs" to test magic items of unknown properties. Retainers may agree to do this, but only if allowed to keep the item in question.
- ***By magic:*** High-level NPC magic-users may also be able to identify magic items. They will always require payment or a service in kind. The process takes time: possibly several weeks.

## [Using Magic Items](name:using_magic_items)

- ***Appropriate use:*** In order to be effective, a magic item must be used, held, or worn in the normal fashion.
- ***Concentration:*** To activate an item's magic, the user must concentrate on its effect. When using a magic item in this way, the character cannot take any other actions.
- ***Items that are always active:*** The following types of item are always active, and do not require concentration: magic weapons, armour, and protective items (e.g. ring of protection, elven cloak).
- ***Actions per round:*** A magic item's effect can normally only be used once per round, unless its description notes otherwise.

## [Wishes](name:wishes)

Several magic items grant wishes, the powerful ability for a character to change the nature of reality in any conceivable way that he or she should desire. Wishes are generally regarded as the most powerful magic in the game, and have the potential to greatly upset the balance of play, if not handled carefully by the referee. The following guidelines may be used:

- ***Wording:*** The player and referee must pay great attention to the precise wording of a wish.
- ***World-changing wishes:*** A wish that would alter some fundamental aspect of the game or the campaign world will have no effect. For example, a wish that altered the abilities of all monsters of a particular type would fail.
- ***Greedy wishes:*** A wish that the referee judges to be unreasonable or overly greedy may come to pass, but with its intent twisted in some way. For example, a wish for a very powerful magic item may cause the item to appear, but in the possession of a dangerous enemy.
- ***Wishing for more wishes:*** Results in an infinite time loop, putting the character out of play.

Some examples of reasonable wishes:

- Wishing for a weapon to help fight magical monsters. The wish may grant a sword +1 that vanishes when the combat ends.
- Wishing that a monster had not attacked. The wish may place the characters back in time and change the reaction of the monster.
- Wishing that a deadly blow had not occurred. The affected character may return to life, wounded but not dead.

A fragile helmet that grants the wearer the ability to read writing of all kinds.

### [Medallion of ESP 90'](name:medallion_of_esp_90)

A medallion on a chain, enchanted with the power of reading thoughts. This works in the same way as the magic-user spell [_ESP_](#esp).

### [Identifying](name:potion_identifying)

A potion may be identified by sipping a small amount. It is difficult to identify potions purely by smell or taste, as even potions with the same effect are not alike.

### [Drinking](name:drinking)

Drinking a full dose of a potion takes one round, and brings on the magical effect for 1d6+6 turns. The referee should roll for and track this duration, and not tell the player how long the potion will last for.

### [Mixing](name:mixing)

Drinking a potion while already under the effects of another potion is dangerous:

- The character is completely disabled for 3 turns, due to sickness.
- The effects of both potions are cancelled.

This rule does not apply to potions with instantaneous or permanent duration (e.g. _potions of healing_, _potions of longevity_).

### [Potion Descriptions](name:potion_descriptions)

- Affects up to 3d6 Hit Dice of normal or giant (but not magical) animals.

***Control Dragon:***

- Affects 1--3 dragons of a specific type. The referee should determine which type of dragon the potion affects.
- It is not possible to command a dragon to cast spells.

***Control Giant:***

- Affects 1--4 giants of a specific type. The referee should determine which type of giant the potion affects.

***Control Human:***

- A charm may be placed upon one human within 60' per round. The subject may **save vs spells** to resist the charm.
- Up to 6 Hit Dice of humans may be charmed in this way. Normal humans count for 1/2 HD.
- A charmed individual regards the character as a trusted friend, and will come to his or her defence. He or she will obey the character's commands, as long as these are not obviously harmful and do not contradict the subject's alignment.

***Control Plant:***

- Affects all plants (including plant monsters) in a 30' square area up to 60' distant.
- Affected plants may be commanded to move around as the character wishes, and may be used to entangle creatures in the area.

- When the potion's effect ends, affected undead have a hostile reaction.

#### [Delusion](name:potion_delusion)

A character who drinks this potion believes he or she is under the effects of another type of potion.

#### [Fire Resistance](name:potion_fire_resistance)

Grants the character protection against fire:

- Unharmed by non-magical heat or fire.
- Gain a +2 bonus to all saving throws versus fire-based magical or breath attacks.

### [Cursed Scrolls](name:cursed_scrolls)

- Merely looking at the baneful script on the scroll curses the character.
- The referee should determine the nature of the curse (see examples below).
- The curse can be removed by magic (e.g. [_remove curse_](#magic_user_remove_curse)), or (at the referee's option) by performing a special quest.

#### [Example Curses](name:example_curses)

1. The reader is transformed into a harmless creature (e.g. a frog).
2. A wandering monster appears next to the reader and attacks (gaining surprise). The monster is of equal level to the reader.
3. A magic item in the reader's possession vanishes. The referee may select the item or choose it at random.
4. The reader permanently loses one experience level (or Hit Die). This incurs a loss of one Hit Die of hit points, as well as all other benefits due to the lost level (e.g. spells, saving throws, etc.). A character's XP is reduced to halfway between the former and new levels. A person who loses all levels dies.
5. The player must re-roll the character's prime requisite.
6. The reader's healing capacity is reduced. Natural healing takes double the normal amount of time, and healing spells only cure half the normal number of hit points.

### [Protection Scrolls](name:protection_scrolls)

Enchanted script that conjures a circle of protection, effective against a specific type of monster or energy.

- Written in non-magical languages (usually Common); usable by all characters.
- When used, conjures a 10' radius circle of protection around the reader.
- If the reader moves, the circle of protection follows him or her.
- For scrolls of protection against monsters: the circle does not prevent affected monsters from using magic or missile attacks against those within it. If anyone within the circle attacks an affected monster in melee, the circle is broken.

#### [Protection from Elementals](name:protection_from_elementals)

- No elemental may enter the circle.
- Lasts for 2 turns, unless broken.

#### [Protection from Lycanthropes](name:protection_from_lycanthropes)

- A number of lycanthropes are barred from entering the circle. The number depends on their Hit Dice: 1--3 HD: 1d10 lycanthropes affected, 4--5 HD: 1d8 affected, 6+ HD: 1d4 affected.
- Lasts for 6 turns, unless broken.

#### [Protection from Magic](name:protection_from_magic)

- Conjures a barrier that spells and spell-like effects (e.g. from magic items) cannot cross.
- The barrier prevents magic from entering the circle, but also from leaving it.
- Last for 1d4 turns.
- Can only be broken by a _wish_.

#### [Protection from Undead](name:protection_from_undead)

- A number of undead monsters are barred from entering the circle of protection. The number depends on their Hit Dice: 1--3 HD: 2d12 undead affected, 4--5 HD: 2d6 undead affected, 6+ HD: 1d6 undead affected.
- Lasts for 6 turns, unless broken.

### [Spell Scrolls](name:spell_scrolls)

Sheets of paper, parchment, papyrus, etc. on which one or more magic spells have been written by a spell caster. 1-in-4 spell scrolls contain divine spells; the rest contain arcane spells.

Casting spells from scrolls works as follows:

- Only arcane spell casters can use scrolls of arcane spells. Only divine spell casters can use scrolls of divine spells.
- The words on the scroll must be read out loud.
- When a spell is cast, the inscription disappears from the scroll. (If a scroll contains multiple spells, only the spell cast disappears.)
- Arcane spells are written in magical script that can only be read by magic (e.g. the [_read magic_](#read_magic) spell).
- Divine spells are written in normal languages (usually Common), but can only be used by divine spell casters.

The referee may choose the spells on a scroll, or may roll for them randomly. The following table may be used to randomly select the level of each spell on a scroll.

B: d6 | X: d% | Spell Level
------|-------|------------
1--3 | 1--25 | 1st
4--5 | 26--50 | 2nd
6 | 51--70 | 3rd
 | 71--85 | 4th
 | 86--95 | 5th
 | 96--00 | 6th*

\* _Re-roll for divine spells._

### [Treasure Maps](name:treasure_maps)

Directions to the location of a valuable treasure. Usable by any character.

- Indicates the route to the indicated treasure, located in a dungeon or wilderness.
- The map may not always be easy to interpret: it may be incomplete, worded in riddles, or written in an obscure language.
- For treasures with a listed gold piece value, the referee may choose what type of treasure is in the hoard. (For example, it may be coins, but could also consist of valuable art objects or jewels.)
- The treasure is normally guarded by enchantments, traps, or monsters (e.g. a monster from the [***Dungeon Encounter Tables***](#dungeon_encounter_tables) of levels 5--6, or higher).
- The referee should prepare treasure maps in advance.

### [Cursed Swords](name:cursed_swords)

- ***Penalty:*** The associated penalty is applied to both attack rolls and damage rolls made with the sword.
- ***Discarding:*** Once the sword has been used in combat, the character comes under the curse and is not able to discard the item. In fact, they will favour the sword and use it whenever possible. The curse can only be removed with magic (e.g. _remove curse_ or _dispel evil_).

### [Enchanted Swords](name:enchanted_swords)

- ***Bonus:*** The associated bonus is applied to both attack rolls and damage rolls made with the sword.
- ***Bonus vs creature type:*** Some swords have a special bonus when used against a certain type of creature.
- ***Sentience:*** Some magic swords have an innate intelligence and personality, along with other special powers. If the referee wishes to randomly determine whether a magic sword is intelligent, the probability is 30%. See [***Sentient Swords***](#sentient_swords), for rules for determining the special powers of a sentient sword.
- ***Special purpose:*** There is additionally a 1-in-20 chance of a magic sword having been imbued with a special purpose. Such swords are extremely powerful and are always sentient. See [***Sentient Swords***](#sentient_swords), for rules for determining the powers of a sword of special purpose. The referee may choose to only place such swords by design, rather than rolling this chance randomly.

### [Sentient Swords](name:sentient_swords)

Some magic swords possess sentience (see [***Swords***](#swords) for the chances of this).

- Sentient swords are intelligent and have a personality of their own. The referee should play them as NPCs.
- Sentient swords have special powers, in addition to their normal enchantment.
- The procedure for designing a sentient sword is given below. Instead of rolling the sword's qualities randomly, the referee may select them as desired.

#### [Rolling a Sentient Sword](name:rolling_a_sentient_sword)

1. ***Special purpose:*** If the sword is imbued with a special purpose (see [***Special Purpose***](#special_purpose), later.
2. ***Intelligence:*** The sword's INT is 1d6+6. Swords imbued with a special purpose always have INT 12.
3. ***Communication:*** The sword's INT determines the means by which it can communicate. See the table below.
    1. ***Empathy:*** The sword cannot communicate directly, but empathically informs the wielder of its powers and how to use them.
    2. ***Speech:*** The sword is able to speak out loud. It knows its alignment tongue, plus the number of languages indicated by rolling on the ***Languages*** table. Languages should be selected by the referee.
    3. ***Reading:*** The sword can read all languages it is able to speak, and is also able to read magical inscriptions.
4. ***Alignment:*** Is determined randomly by rolling on the table below.
5. ***Powers:*** The sword's INT determines the number of powers it has. See the table below. Powers are described below.
6. ***Ego:*** In addition to INT, sentient swords have an Ego rating---a measure of their force of personality. This is rolled on 1d12. Swords imbued with a special purpose always have an Ego of 12.

#### [Communication](name:communication)

INT | Reading | Communication
----|---------|--------------
7 | No | Empathy
8 | No | Empathy
9 | No | Empathy
10 | No | Speech
11 | Yes | Speech
12 | Yes | Speech

#### [Languages](name:sword_languages)

d100 | Languages
-----|----------
01--50 | 1
51--70 | 2
71--85 | 3
86--95 | 4
96--99 | 5
00 | Roll twice again, adding results

#### [Powers](name:powers)

INT | Powers
----|-------
7 | 1 sensory power
8 | 2 sensory powers
9 | 3 sensory powers
10 | 3 sensory powers
11 | 3 sensory powers
12 | 3 sensory powers + 1 extraordinary power

#### [Alignment](name:sword_alignment)

d20 | Alignment
----|----------
1--13 | Lawful
14--18 | Neutral
19--20 | Chaotic

The alignment of the sword can only be determined by touching it. Doing so may incur damage, if the character is of a different alignment to the sword:

- ***Lawful swords:*** Inflict 1d6 damage per round to Neutral characters, and 2d6 per round to Chaotic characters.
- ***Neutral swords:*** Inflict 1d6 damage per round to non-Neutral characters.
- ***Chaotic swords:*** Inflict 1d6 damage per round to Neutral characters, and 2d6 per round to Lawful characters.

#### [Using a Sentient Sword](name:using_a_sentient_sword)

Sentient swords grant the wielder special powers beyond those of a normal magic sword, but using such an item also carries certain risks.

#### [Activating Powers](name:activating_powers)

- To use a power, the sword must be in the wielder's hand.
- The wielder must concentrate to activate a power.

#### [Control](name:sword_control)

A sentient sword has its own personality, and can, at times, attempt to exercise control over the person who wields it. A control check (see below) is triggered in any of the following circumstances:

- ***First contact:*** Upon the character first touching the sword.
- ***Wounded:*** When the character is reduced to half hit points or less.
- ***Jealousy:*** When another magic weapon comes into the character's possession.
- ***Alignment difference:*** Upon every use, if the sword and the character are of different alignments.
- ***Special purpose:*** If the sword has a special purpose: every time the special purpose is applicable. (e.g. when encountering a character or creature of the type the sword is designed to slay.)

##### [Control Checks](name:control_checks)

When one of the aforementioned circumstances occurs, a control check is required:

1. Determine the sword's Will score:
    1. The sum of its INT and Ego.
    2. Plus one for each extraordinary power the sword has.
    3. Plus 1d10, if the sword and the wielder of are different alignments.
2. Determine the wielder's Will score:
    1. The sum of STR and WIS scores.
    2. If the character has less than full hit points, Will is reduced by 1d4 (or 2d4, if the character has less than half hit points).
3. Compare the Will scores. If the sword's Will score is higher, it takes control of the character's actions.

##### [When the Sword Takes Control](name:when_the_sword_takes_control)

The referee determines the behaviour of the character, via the sword, for example:

- Discarding other weapons, or ignoring newly discovered magic weapons.
- Charging into battle, to gain glory for the sword.
- Surrendering to a foe whom the sword deems either more worthy of possessing it or more susceptible to being controlled.
- Making lavish expenditures for the sword: purchasing expensive sheaths, having jewels fitted, having enchantments and wards applied, etc. The sword may force the character to spend most of his or her money on such things!

##### [When Control Ends](name:when_control_ends)

Once in control, the sword will only release the character when the circumstance that triggered the control check is over, or when the sword is otherwise satisfied.

#### [Extraordinary Powers](name:extraordinary_powers)

- Each power should be rolled on the table below. Duplicates should be re-rolled, unless noted.
- Unless a power's description notes otherwise, it may be used at most three times a day.

d6 | Target
---|-------
1 | Arcane spell casters
2 | Divine spell casters
3 | Warriors (e.g. fighters or other primarily combat-oriented, non-spell casting classes, including non-spell casting demihumans)

- On a successful hit, the wielder may command the sword to drain the victim's life energy.
- In this case, in addition to suffering normal damage, the target permanently loses one experience level (or Hit Die). This incurs a loss of one Hit Die of hit points, as well as all other benefits due to the drained level (e.g. spells, saving throws, etc.). A character's XP is reduced to the lowest amount for the new level. A person drained of all levels dies.

The referee may choose the type of armour in a treasure hoard, or may roll on the following table:

d8 | Type of Armour
---|---------------
1--2 | Leather
3--6 | Chainmail
7--8 | Plate mail

### [Enchanted Armour and Shields](name:enchanted_armour_and_shields)

- ***Weight:*** When using [option 2 of the encumbrance rules](#encumbrance_by_weight), the enchanted armour's encumbrance value is 50% less than that of normal armour.

### [Cursed Armour and Shields](name:cursed_armour_and_shields)

- ***AC penalty:*** Some types of cursed armour specify an Armour Class penalty. This modifier worsens the wearer's Armour Class rating. For example, a cursed suit of chainmail &minus;1 grants a base Armour Class of 6, one point worse than the AC 5 of non-magical chainmail.
- ***AC 9:*** Some types of cursed armour give the wearer a base Armour Class of 9 (before modifiers due to Dexterity).
- ***Testing:*** All types of tests indicate that a cursed shield or suit of armour is enchanted with a +1 bonus. It is only when the armour is used in deadly combat that the curse is revealed.
- ***Removing:*** Once a cursed shield or suit of armour has been used, the character comes under the curse and is not able to discard the item. It can only be removed with magic (e.g. _remove curse_ or _dispel evil_).

# [Monsters](name:monsters)

## [Notes](name:monster_notes)

### [High-Level Saves](name:high_level_saves)

Some powerful monsters save as a fighter of greater than 14th level. In these cases, the monster's save values have been calculated by extrapolating the progression of the fighter saving throw chart to higher levels.

### [Infravision](name:monster_infravision)

All non-human monsters have 60' [infravision](#infravision).

### [Persons](name:persons)

Spells such as [_charm person_](#charm_person), [_hold person_](#magic_user_hold_person), etc. only affect humanoids (including humans and demihumans) of up to 4+1HD. Monsters in this book that are affected by these spells are: acolyte, bandit, berserker, brigand, buccaneer, bugbear, dervish, dwarf, elf, gnoll, gnome, goblin, halfling, hobgoblin, kobold, lizard man, medium, merchant, neanderthal, nixie, noble, normal human, ogre, orc, pirate, pixie, sprite, trader, troglodyte, veteran. Other monsters may be affected at the referee's judgement.

### [XP Value of NPCs](name:xp_value_of_npcs)

Some monster entries make reference to NPCs with levels in a specific character class. The XP values for such characters are not pre-calculated, as the exact value depends on several variable factors.

When awarding XP for defeated NPCs, the referee may use the following guidelines:

- The base Hit Dice are equal to the NPC's experience level.
- Spell casters are treated as having one special ability per two levels of spells they can cast (rounded up). For example, a character able to cast 1st, 2nd, and 3rd level spells would count as having two special abilities.
- Magic items in the possession of the character may be counted as special abilities, if they play a direct role in combat.

## [Stat Block Format](name:stat_block_format)

***AC:*** Armour Class.

***HD:*** Hit Dice. Roll this number of d8s to determine each individual's hit points.

- One or more asterisks after the HD number indicate the number of special abilities the monster has, for the purpose of XP calculation.
- Modifiers to the HD (e.g. +3, &minus;1) are applied to the hit point total, after rolling the appropriate number of d8s.
- Some monsters are listed as having less than one HD, either as 1/2 (roll 1d4) or as a fixed number of hit points.
- The average hit point value is also listed, in parentheses.

***Att:*** Attacks usable each round. Square brackets are used to distinguish between alternative attack routines that a monster may choose from.

***SV:*** The monster's saving throw values: D=death/poison, W=wands, P=paralysis/petrification, B=breath attacks, S=spells/rods/staves. The equivalent character class and level are listed in parentheses afterwards (C=Cleric, D=Dwarf, E=Elf, F=Fighter, H=Halfling, MU=Magic-User, NH=Normal Human, T=Thief).

***THAC0:*** Value required "to hit AC 0". This value may optionally be used to resolve the monster's attack rolls, instead of referring to the attack chart based on its HD. To calculate the AC hit by an attack, subtract the result of the attack roll from the THAC0 score. For example, if a monster with THAC0 12 makes an attack roll of 9, it hits AC 3 (12 - 9).

***MV:*** Base movement rate; encounter movement rate in parentheses. If the monster has multiple modes of movement, they are listed individually, separated by slashes.

***ML:*** Morale rating.

***AL:*** Alignment. If "any" is listed, the referee may roll randomly or choose the creature's alignment.

***XP:*** Pre-calculated XP award for defeating the monster.

***NA:*** Number appearing. Two values are listed, the second in parentheses. These values are used as follows:

- Wandering (dungeon): The first value indicates the number of monsters encountered roaming in a dungeon level equal to their HD. If the listed value is zero, these monsters are not usually encountered in dungeons. If the monster is encountered on a level greater than its HD, the number appearing may be increased; if encountered on a level less than its HD, the number appearing should be reduced.
- Lair (dungeon): The second value lists the number of monsters found in a lair in a dungeon. If the listed value is zero, these monsters do not usually have lairs.
- Wandering (wilderness): The second value indicates the number of monsters encountered roaming in the wilderness. If the listed value is zero, these monsters are not usually encountered in the wilderness.
- Lair (wilderness): The second value multiplied by 5 indicates the number of monsters found in a lair in the wilderness. If the listed value is zero, these monsters are not usually encountered in the wilderness.

***TT:*** Treasure type. The letter code used to determine the amount and type of treasure possessed by the monster(s) (see [***Treasure Typess***](#treasure_types)). The letters listed are used as follows:

- A to O: Indicate a hoard: the sum wealth of a large monster or a community of smaller monsters. Such hoards are usually hidden in the lair. For monsters with a lair encounter size (see _NA_, above) of greater than 1d4, the amount of treasure in the hoard may be reduced, if the number of monsters is below average.
- P to V: If listed for an intelligent monster, indicate treasure carried by individuals (P to T) or a group (U, V). If listed for an unintelligent monster, indicates treasure from the bodies of its former victims.

- ***Behaviour:*** Chaotic dragons usually try to eat humans, but may sometimes capture them. Neutral dragons may attack or ignore humans. Lawful dragons may aid parties worthy of the honour.
- ***Pride:*** Dragons are immensely proud creatures and will always listen to flattery.
- ***Attack pattern:*** A dragon always attacks first with its breath weapon, then either breathes again or makes melee attacks (equal chance of either).
- ***Breath weapon:*** Can be used up to three times per day. All caught in the area suffer damage equal to the dragon's current hit points (**save vs breath** for half). Shapes of breath weapon:
    -  ***Cloud:*** 50' long, 40' wide, 20' high.
    -  ***Cone:*** 2' wide at the mouth, 30' wide at far end.
    -  ***Line:*** 5' wide along whole length.
- ***Energy immunity:*** Unharmed by their own breath weapon or lesser versions thereof. Automatically save versus similar attack forms. (For example, a red dragon is immune to flaming oil and suffers half damage from fire ball spells.)

- ***Sleeping:*** The chance of a dragon being asleep when encountered on the ground is listed by subspecies. A sleeping dragon may be attacked for one round with a +2 bonus to hit. Dragons may sometimes pretend to be asleep!

- ***Subduing:*** Will surrender if reduced to 0hp by [non-lethal attacks](#non_lethal_combat), admitting that it has been defeated. (Subdual damage does not reduce the damage done by the breath weapon.) A subdued dragon will attempt to escape or attack its captors, if the opportunity presents itself or if given a suicidal command. A subdued dragon may be sold for at most 1,000gp per hit point.
- ***Age:*** The following stats describe dragons of average size. Younger dragons may have up to 3 HD less and 1/4 or 1/2 as much treasure. Older dragons may have up to 3 HD more and twice as much treasure.
